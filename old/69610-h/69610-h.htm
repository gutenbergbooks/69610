<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>Gone!</span>” said the cook, tragically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They <span class='it'>can’t</span> be,” said the parlourmaid,
with that blank disbelief that is so helpful
in times of stress. “Did you look in the
cake-tin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I look in the cake-tin?” demanded
the cook, in tones of fury. “They was
never in the cake-tin, and they aren’t now.
Wotever may be the custom in your home,
Elizer, it’s not my ’abit to pile up fresh
cream-puffs in a cake-tin when they’re all
filled with cream and just ready for a party.
’Ow’d they look, I arsk you, all messed up,
and the cream stickin’ ’ere and there on ’em
in blobs? I left ’em spread out singly on
them two big blue dishes, same as I could
serve ’em in two jiffs. And they’re gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the dishes, right enough,” said
the parlourmaid, still bent on being helpful.
She inspected faint traces of cream on
their blue expanse, with the air of a Sherlock
Holmes. “They been there once, anyone
can see. Oh, have another think, Cook,
dear—you must have put them on the cake-plates!”
She dashed hopefully at a large
safe, peered into its recesses, and lost heart
visibly on meeting only the cold stare of a
big sirloin and a string of pallid sausages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyone as ’ud think I’d put cream-puffs
in the meat-safe—!” said the cook,
wearily. “ ’Ave sense, Elizer, if it’s any
way possible. I tell you, I left ’em on the
blue dishes; there’s the cake-plates all ready
for ’em, clean d’oyleys an’ all. An’ not a
cream-puff left! Well, you can search <span class='it'>me</span>.
I give up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where can they have gone to?”
wailed Eliza, dismally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno. But there’s young limbs in
this school as is equal to anything. It ain’t
the first time things ’ave disappeared from
my pantry. Scones I’ve missed, time and
again; and there was sausage-rolls last
week, and ’alf a jam-sandwidge another
time. Lots of little oddments, as you
might say. But this is ’olesale, an’ no mistake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza was understood to murmur something
feebly about the cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cat!” said the cook. “There’s cats
enough and to spare, goodness knows, but
cats don’t browse on scones and cream-puffs.
It’s two-legged cats, or my name’s
not Mary Ann Spinks—you mark my words,
Elizer! Not that I’d mention names, nor
even red ’air; but I have me suspicions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Red hair!” ejaculated Eliza. “You
aren’t thinking of Lucy Armitage? Her
that’s a prefect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not,” said the cook. “Prefeck or
no prefeck, that one ’ud never ’ave spirit
enough to come a-raidin’ anyone’s pantry.
Not that I ’old with raidin’, Elizer,
’specially when it’s me own pantry. But I
was young meself once, an’ I remember
there was an apple-tree me an’ me brothers
used to visit. Not our own apple-tree. I
’ave me memories. The apples weren’t any
too good, ’specially as we always collared
’em green. It wasn’t ’ardly the apples we
cared for, but the fun of it. Ah, well, one’s
only young once, an’ the school food ain’t
any too good either, as I well know.” The
cook sighed, and apparently gave herself
up to her memories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But raiding’s just stealing!” said Eliza,
whose youth held no such recollections of
buccaneering. She regarded the fat cook
with a cold and disapproving eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not when you’re young it ain’t,” defended
the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t see any difference,” Eliza
stated. “Don’t the collect say to keep one’s
hands from picking and stealing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the collecks!” said the cook.
“Them as wrote the collecks weren’t young,
either. ’Tisn’t all of us lives up to ’em all
the time—until we grow up, of course,
that’s to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza was thinking deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Red hair!” she murmured. “Young
Robin Hurst has red hair, and so has
Annette Riley. Is it either of them you’re
thinking of, Cook?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not thinkin’ of anyone in particular,”
averred the cook, definitely. “Not my
business to think. Wot you an’ I ’ave got
to bend our minds to is Miss Stone, an’
wot she’s goin’ to say when she finds
there’s no cream-puffs for her party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Hevins, yes!” agreed Eliza. “And
she’s that particular about having them always!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I know it!” the cook uttered.
“ ’Cause why, they’re my specialty, an’ always
’ave been, wherever I’ve cooked.
‘Cream-puffs, of course, Cook,’ says she,
yesterday, as sweet as sugar; ‘it isn’t a
Calton Hall party without your puffs, you
know!’ An’, though I says it, Elizer, they
was never better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair melted in me mouth, the ones you
gave me, Cook,” said Eliza, soulfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would so. I must say, I’d like to
see ’ow they manage ’em in the drorin-room,
all in their Sunday best,” pondered
the cook. “I can’t eat a cream-puff meself
without needin’ a wash afterwards. But I
s’pose they ’ave their dodges. Well, they
won’t get any this afternoon to worry
about, an’ that’s that. An’ it’s near four
o’clock now, Elizer, an’ we’ve got to think
of a substichoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My goodness!” Eliza uttered. “What
are you goin’ to give ’em, Cook?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy Mixed!” said the cook, grimly,
advancing with slow dignity towards a tin
that graced the upper shelf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Biscuits!” breathed Eliza, faintly. “She’ll
take a fit, Miss Stone will. I never saw
biscuits at one of her parties, all the time
I’ve been here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, an’ you never won’t again, if I
know it. I reckon I’ll keep the key of me
pantry firm an’ tight in me pocket after
this. It’s lowerin’ to me pride to send in
fancy-mixed, but there it is—I ain’t a
jugular, to conjure up a fresh set of puffs
in ten minutes. Oh, well, they won’t starve:
me scones take some beatin’, an’ there’s the
other cakes. But them puffs lend tone to
a party, Elizer, as you well know: an’ this
particular party’s goin’ to be lackin’ in
tone. Just you make the biscuits look as
respectable as you can, while I make the
tea: the bell’ll go any minute.” And Eliza,
sighing deeply, prepared to face the tragedy
of the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, under a great pine-tree that
stood in the corner of the Calton Hall playground,
three girls sat in a state of palpitating
expectancy. School was dismissed
for the day, and the “crocodile” walk,
loathed by the boarders, which usually
followed hard upon the heels of the last
lesson, was not to take place—a joyful
omission which always signalized the afternoons
when Miss Stone gave a party, since
the junior governesses, who escorted the
“crocodile,” were required in the drawing-room
to assist in pouring out tea. Sounds
of mirth came from the tennis-courts,
where a hastily-arranged tournament was
in full swing. Across the playground the
space sacred to juniors echoed with the
shrill cries attending a game of rounders:
other enthusiasts made merry over basketball.
But the three under the pine-tree,
although ready for tennis, were evidently
a prey to emotions deeper than could be
excited, at the moment, by any ordinary
game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know she’s been caught!” Annette
Riley breathed, anxiously. “She ought to
have been here ages ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, give her time,” said Joyce Harrison,
endeavouring to be comforting. “She
might have been delayed in ever so many
ways. Ten to one she’s found that the
whole thing is no go, and she’s given it
up, and is getting into her tennis things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not Robin,” said Betty O’Hara, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Robin can’t do everything she
wants to, no matter how plucky she is,”
Joyce responded. “And I really do hope
she isn’t going to pull this off. She’s been
in such an awful lot of rows already this
term—Miss Stone’s getting madder and
madder about her. I wish that silly ass of
a Ruby hadn’t dared her to go raiding the
sacred pantry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Annette. “Everyone
knows it isn’t safe to dare Robin to do anything.
If you told her she wasn’t game to
climb feet foremost up the electric-light
pole, she’d be doing it in five minutes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruby Bennett takes advantage of that,”
Betty said hotly. “Half the scrapes that
Robin has been in this term have had
Ruby’s nasty little jeers at the bottom of
them. And Robin’s such a dear old blind
bat that she never sees it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Robin seems to like rows,” said
Joyce. “But there will be an awful one if
she’s caught this time.” She dropped her
voice dramatically. “When Mother was
down last week Miss Stone talked to her
in her very stoniest manner about my being
friends with Robin——said all sorts of
horrid things about her wildness, and that
she had a bad influence in the school. Poor
old Mother was quite worried about it, until
I made her see that Robin is just the
straightest ever—she does mad things, but
she wouldn’t tell a lie if she were burned
alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should just say she wouldn’t!” uttered
Betty. “Robin a bad influence, indeed!
I never heard such rubbish. Why, there
isn’t a junior that wouldn’t lick her boots!
Prigs like Lucy Armitage, of course——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, old Lucy isn’t bad,” said Annette.
“She’s rather overweighted by being a prefect,
that’s all. She’s worried about Robin
too, because Miss Stone told her she meant
to make an example of her, next time she
broke a rule. And Robin’s simply incapable
of not breaking rules!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she never does an underhand thing,
as half of Miss Stone’s pets do,” said Betty.
“Everyone knows that girls whose parents
have money are all right in this school:
Miss Stone keeps her telescope to her blind
eye where they are concerned. If Robin’s
mean old uncle were a bit more generous to
her, she wouldn’t be Miss Stone’s black
sheep. He must be a horrid old pig! Robin
and her mother have a perfectly vile time
at home. It’s no wonder the poor darling
kicks over the traces when she gets away
from him.” She fanned herself with her
racquet. “I wish she’d come—it will be
time for out set very soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder if Miss Stone has caught her
and locked her up,” conjectured Joyce,
gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much she hasn’t!” said a cheerful
voice—and the three girls sprang up with
exclamations of delight as a fourth whirled
suddenly into their midst, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robin!—you didn’t manage it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weren’t caught?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us what happened!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easiest thing ever,” said Robin Hurst
cheerfully, sitting down on the thick carpet
of pine-needles. “I waited until the front-door
bell was going every two minutes and
Eliza was marking time between rings in
the hall, and then I slipped into the servery.
Cookie was up to her eyes in hot scones:
just as she was brooding over the cooking
of a great oven-trayful I dodged into the
pantry—and oh, girls, you should have
seen the cream-puffs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cream-puffs—wow!” said Annette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were just waiting for me—two
big blue dishes full. It seemed a sin to
leave any, so I didn’t. That little suit-case
of yours just held them all, Annette, darling—it’ll
be a bit creamy, but I’ll clean it
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And nobody saw you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a soul. It didn’t take two minutes.
I shot up the back stairs just as Eliza came
out—she was too full of importance to
glance upwards, and tennis-shoes are nice
quiet things. We’ll have a gorgeous supper
to-night—and I’ll show Ruby Bennett
I’m not as scared as she tried to make out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed defiantly, tossing her hat
from her mane of bright red hair. Even
though shingled, Robin Hurst’s hair was a
defiant mop, resisting all her efforts to make
it resemble the sleek demureness of her
schoolfellows’ heads. Its very colour was
defiant: no such head of flame had ever
before enlivened the sober rooms of Calton
Hall. It blazed round a narrow delicate
face, with clear pale skin that made its
owner furious by its trick of blushing at
the slightest provocation. Until humourously-inclined
schoolgirls had found that
the pastime was dangerous, it had been considered
rather good fun to make Robin
blush—to see the quick wave of colour
surge to the very roots of her hair, and
even down her neck. That was two years
ago, when she had been a new girl, shy
and uncertain of herself. Now that she
was nearly sixteen, no one took liberties—it
was too much like jesting with gunpowder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest, she was tall and very slender—almost
boyish in her clean length of
limb; with brown eyes that were rarely
without a twinkle, and a mouth altogether
too wide for good looks, with a little upward
quirk at the corners. Lessons were
abhorrent to her; history and poetry she
loved, but in every other subject she held
a firm position at the bottom of her class,
and was wholly unrepentant about it. The
teachers liked her, while they despaired of
her. Miss Stone, the principal, regarded
her with cold disapproval, as a girl who
was never likely to reflect the slightest
credit on the school. From the first she
had shown a disregard of law and order
that landed her perpetually in trouble.
Whatever might be her deficiencies in class,
she was possessed of an amazing ability for
getting into scrapes—and for laughing her
way out of them. She took her penalties
cheerfully, and was ready to plan fresh mischief
the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An impatient hail came from the tennis-courts,
and the four girls gathered themselves
up and ran to answer it. Over a
hard-fought set Robin apparently forgot
altogether that any weight of crime lay
upon her shoulders—possibly because she
did not regard the raiding of a pantry as in
the least criminal. She prepared for tea
with serene cheerfulness, that deepened a
little as she met Ruby Bennett’s enquiring
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how did the raid go?” asked Ruby,
lightly. One was never quite sure of one’s
ground with Robin: it was necessary to feel
one’s way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What raid?” queried Robin, with an air
of sublime innocence. They were filing
into the dining-room, and conversation was
frowned upon by the authorities during the
procession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triumph flashed into the other girl’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you wouldn’t be game!” she
said, smiling unpleasantly. She went to
her place, radiating satisfaction. Miss
Stone was not present; it was usual for her
to remain in seclusion on the evening following
a party. The teachers, especially the
junior ones, looked rather troubled, as if
the festivity had not brought pleasure in its
train. They were preoccupied, and when
conversation at the long tables rose above
its permitted hum they failed to quell it
with their customary promptness. There
were plates of biscuits on their table—Fancy
Mixed—but they seemed to regard
them without appetite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These things did not trouble the pupils,
who were unusually hungry—hard exercise
in the playground having more effect upon
the appetite than the slow and sinuous
meanderings of a walk in crocodile formation.
They ate all before them, and did not
grumble unduly at the jam, which was that
peculiar blend that arrives in very large
tins, and is said to be nutritious—as,
indeed, it may well be, having as a basis
the wholesome turnip and vegetable marrow.
Calton Hall was one of those semi-fashionable
private schools that loom attractively
in advertisements and preserve a certain
amount of outside show, while assisting
profits by a steady system of cheese-paring
in matters under the surface: its boarders
owed much of their healthy appearance to
the fact that the digestion of youth is tough
and long-enduring. Tea being over, they
dispersed for the half-hour of liberty before
preparation: during which time Robin
and her friends were at some pains to avoid
Ruby Bennett. That damsel was clearly
bent on triumphing openly. Since, however,
she could not find Robin, she philosophically
postponed her jibes until bedtime,
when her victim would be at her
mercy in the dormitory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby was not the only occupant of Number
Four who went up to bed with a keen
sense of anticipation. Every girl knew that
she had dared Robin Hurst to raid Miss
Stone’s pantry: eight out of the twelve had
gathered, more or less indirectly, that Robin
had not taken up the challenge—and it was
always interesting to see Robin baited,
especially by Ruby Bennett, who had a
very unpleasant knowledge of the best
places to plant her winged darts. Robin’s
peppery temper lent peculiar excitement to
the frequent encounters between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, therefore, extremely disappointing
to find that Robin took all Ruby’s jeers
meekly on this eventful evening. She said
very little, and what she did say was vague:
she alluded apologetically to the manifold
risks of raiding before a party, and led
them to infer that her spirit had quailed at
the task. Ruby rose to the occasion with
vigour, though she might have been warned
by her adversary’s suspicious humility:
now was her chance to be avenged for
many encounters when Robin had triumphed.
She let all her smouldering jealousy
of the more popular girl find vent in her
sneers, until Number Four marvelled at
Robin’s self-restraint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That lasted until the lights were out and
the teacher on duty had made her round.
Then came stealthy movements and choked
laughter; and the flash of Annette’s electric
torch revealed Robin perched on the end
of Betty’s bed, an elfish figure in pale-blue
pyjamas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friends—Romans—countrymen!” she
declaimed. “Are you awake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten convulsive moments demonstrated
that the dormitory was indeed astir. There
was a sense of development in the air.
Betty O’Hara giggled hopelessly. Ruby lay
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Stone regrets—I feel sure she regrets—the
poor and insufficient food set
before you at the evening meal. She realizes
that more is owing to you; that you cannot
be expected to sleep without a little extra
nourishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robin, you lunatic—what have you been
up to?” ejaculated someone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not a lunatic,” said Robin, with
dignity. “I am the commissariat department
of this dormitory, just as Ruby is its
top-notch orator—when she gets a chance.
It is my joyful privilege to beg you all to
sit up—which I perceive ten of you are already
doing—and to invite you to join in
Miss Stone’s party festivities. Willingly
and gladly have her guests denied themselves
that you may now feast on Cook’s
extra-special cream-puffs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smothered yelps of joy broke out from
the beds, and leaping figures hastened to
form a ring round the red-haired speaker.
Many hands patted her on the back, until
she begged for mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep off, you stupids! And for goodness’
sake, be quiet, or you’ll have Miss
Bryant in! Got the suit-case, Betty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robin, darling, how did you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite easy, when you know how,” said
Robin, airily. She opened the suit-case, and
the torch revealed a mass of cream-cakes,
more or less amalgamated by this time. But
no one was critical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help yourselves, everybody.” No second
bidding was necessary. Ten hands plunged
into the booty, and choked sounds of satisfaction
arose. From Ruby’s bed came
neither voice nor movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cream-puff, Ruby?” invited Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks,” said Ruby, sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad!” said the commissariat department.
She selected a fairly undamaged puff,
and took it over to Ruby’s bed, holding it
within an inch of her nose. The nose
twitched longingly, but pride was stronger
than hunger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want it, I tell you. Take it away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I really couldn’t,” said Robin, lightly.
“They’re ever so good, aren’t they,
girls? I couldn’t bear you to go without
any, when I really did risk my life and
liberty to get them for you.” She laid the
delicacy gently on Ruby’s pillow, disregarding
a furious command to take it away,
and capered back to the circle of girls, who
were choking with laughter, between mouthfuls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All gone!” said Joyce, mournfully. “Oh,
but they were lovely, Robin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robin Hurst!” said Betty, suddenly.
“You never had one yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I?” answered Robin, innocently.
“Well, that was an oversight on my part.
Never mind, I really don’t much like
squashed cream-puff. Next time I have the
chance of—er—abstracting any, young
ladies, I shall endeavour to pack them more
neatly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s a shame, Robin—when you
ran all the risk. What beasts we are! And
I had three!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had all the fun—except what Ruby
had,” laughed Robin. “It was worth it.
And Ruby did enjoy herself so. Own up
you’re beaten, Ruby, and eat that puff!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cave!” said someone, in a sharp whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a faint sound in the passage.
Robin shot the empty suit-case under the
bed, and in a moment every girl’s head was
meekly on her pillow, as the door opened
and Miss Stone’s portly figure appeared.
She switched on the dormitory light. Behind
her, Miss Bryant’s face showed, worried
and anxious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls, what are you doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was profound silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard your voices—you need not pretend
to be asleep.” The principal’s angry
glance swept the long room. “Joyce Harrison—what
have you been doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talking, Miss Stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer. Mild surprise was visible on
Joyce’s innocent face. Talking in bed was
against the rules—to admit to one breach
of regulations seemed to her sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not try to hide your guilt
from me,” boomed Miss Stone, in tones of
concentrated wrath. “I am very certain
of what has been going on.” She moved
from one bed to another, peering with
short-sighted eyes. “What is that on your
pillow, Ruby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a hasty step forward, and her
foot caught on a trailing blanket. Stumbling,
she put out her hand, to save herself.
It came down squarely on Ruby’s neglected
cream-puff. Triumph mingled with disgust
as she regained her balance, cream dripping
from the hand she held aloft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought as much! A towel, if you
please, Miss Bryant—quickly! You wicked,
deceitful girls! Which of you stole these
cakes from my pantry this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The profound silence that greeted this
question was broken by a smothered burst
of irrepressible laughter from two beds at
the end of the room. The scene had been
too much for Robin and Betty. They ducked
their heads beneath the clothes, whence
gurgles proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all that was necessary to fan Miss
Stone’s anger to white heat. Words failed
her for a moment, while she rubbed furiously
at her sticky hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find it by no means a joke,
young ladies,” she said, bitterly, her voice
shaking. “Ruby Bennett, what do you
know of this theft?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t do it,” said Ruby, sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cake was on your pillow—do you
think I am going to believe that you know
nothing of it? Answer me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never touched your cakes—and I
never ate any,” Ruby gulped. Fear of Miss
Stone’s wrath mingled with fear of her
schoolfellows, should she tell all she longed
to tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you put the cake on your pillow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then who did?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin Hurst sat up in bed, her hair a
vivid flame round her pale face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Ruby doesn’t know anything about
it, Miss Stone,” she said, her voice faintly
bored. “I did it all. None of the others
had anything to do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce, Betty, and Annette bobbed up with
Jack-in-the-box effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were in it too, Miss Stone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not true!” flashed Robin. “I
took them by myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Stone surveyed them bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had guessed you were at the bottom
of it, Robin Hurst,” she said. “No other
girl in the school would lower herself by
the actions in which you find pleasure. I
warned you last week—this time I shall
certainly make an example of you. Do not
go into school in the morning; you may
come to my study at half-past-nine!” She
swept majestically from the room, leaving
silence and consternation behind her.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>NEXT DAY</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> school hummed in the morning. Before
breakfast it was known that a row
transcending all other rows had occurred
in the night, and that Robin Hurst, who
had figured in so many scrapes before, was
liable to “catch it” this time with unexampled
severity. Fearful stories of the
wrath of Miss Stone circulated among the
juniors. It was reported that she had
fallen into a basket of stolen cream-puffs,
rising in a condition of messiness and
fury most terrifying to contemplate. That
Robin had been foolish enough to laugh
at the wrong moment was readily believed—it
was the kind of lunatic thing that
Robin would do. As to her punishment,
the school palpitated amid the wildest
guesses. Expulsion was hinted at by a
few, since ordinary penalties seemed
feeble, considering Miss Stone’s anger.
The whole dormitory was to suffer—except
Ruby Bennett, who, having instigated
the crime, had refused to share in its fruits.
Ruby found herself ostentatiously cold-shouldered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever thoughts or doubts mingled
in Robin’s mind, she gave no hint of them
to anyone else. Before breakfast, she
risked further trouble by a whirlwind visit
to the kitchen, for the purpose of making
her peace with the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I gave you an awful lot of
trouble, Cook,” she said, breathlessly. “It
wasn’t that I really wanted the blessed
things, you know—but it was a dare, so I
had to get them. Please don’t be cross
with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some day you’ll take a dare once too
often, my young lady!” said Cook, affecting
sternness, and grinning in spite of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure that I haven’t done it this
time,” answered Robin, with a sigh and a
twinkle. “There’s going to be an awful
row. Well, I don’t care if I am sent away—except
for Mother. She’d hate it. If
I’m only a red-haired memory to-morrow,
Cookie, darling, think of me kindly and remember
I loved you. And they were
scrumptious cream-puffs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say you never tasted one of them,”
said the cook. For gossip travels swiftly
in a school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin tilted her nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—no,” she said. “I don’t snare
things to eat them myself. It’s different,
you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hardly a lucid explanation, but the
cook saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, between you an’ me, I rather any
day they went to you young things than
to the droring-room,” she said. “I ’ope
she won’t be too ’ard on you, my dear, for
’twas only a prank—but ’er state of mind
was fair ’orrible, Elizer said, when she saw
them Fancy Mixed biscuits I ’ad to send
in, instead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin gave a low chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be,” she said. “Well I must
run, Cookie dear, for it will be the end of
all things if I’m caught. But I had to
tell you I was sorry!” She flashed a smile
at the cook, and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breakfast was eaten in unhappy silence:
the weight of disgrace that lay over Number
Four dormitory was felt by all the
boarders, and many surreptitious glances
were stolen at Miss Stone’s grim face,
striving to forecast the extent of the
penalty to be exacted from the chief sinner.
In the playground, afterwards, Robin found
her three allies banded together by a high
resolve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going in with you,” Betty stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Miss Stone? Indeed you’re not,
my children!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re just as much in it as you are,”
said Annette. “We knew all about it beforehand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard such rubbish,” said Robin,
laughing. “I was the only criminal, and
now I’m the only one asked to the party.
You can’t butt in without an invitation—it
isn’t polite!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bother politeness!” Betty’s voice was
almost tearful. “It will be ever so much
better if she has four of us to deal with,
Robin, dear—she can’t expel four of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She isn’t likely to expel any one,” Robin
answered, in cheery tones that hid her own
forebodings. “But if she is, I’m the one,
and you three have nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t fair for you to put on that
‘Alone I did it!’ air,” said Joyce. “You
were only the catspaw; as Annette says, we
knew all about it, so we’re just as guilty.
I think all Number Four ought to go in
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—Ruby too? Wild horses
wouldn’t drag her, and you know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—Ruby!” Joyce’s tone was scornful.
“She doesn’t count. Anyone else
would have whipped that beastly cream-puff
under her pillow, but she just let it
sit there to give us all away. She’s an outcast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll emerge with a perfectly good
halo, in Miss Stone’s eyes,” said Robin,
laughing. “I can see Ruby as a prefect
before long, ruling us all with a rod of
iron. But truly, girls, you can’t come with
me. I’ve got to take my gruel alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t stop us,” Betty said, stubbornly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will only make things worse,” Robin
pleaded. “Miss Stone wants a victim, but
she doesn’t want four: she will be madder
than ever if you all march into the study.
And it isn’t fair, no matter how you look
at it. I’m the Knave of Hearts who stole
the tarts, and if I have to be beaten full
sore, well, it’s just. You can’t get away
from it, that it is just.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Justice is all right, but Miss Stone can
be such a pig,” said Annette. “If she hadn’t
such a down on you, already, Robin, we
wouldn’t mind. We’re coming, and that’s
all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big bell clanged out, and from every
quarter the girls began to hurry towards
the schoolroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must go,” Robin said, straightening
her shoulders. “Trot off into school,
my dears, or you will be marked late.” She
smiled at them, turning to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re coming,” said the three, in an
obstinate chorus. They formed round
her, and marched across the playground
and into the house, while Robin protested
vainly. She was still protesting when they
reached the study door and Joyce tapped
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Stone’s eyebrows went up as they
filed into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I summoned Robin only,” she said,
stiffly. “Why are you all here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were in it too, Miss Stone,” Joyce
said. “It doesn’t seem fair to us for Robin
to take all the blame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The principal looked at them indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly I have not understood fully,”
she said, with cold politeness. “You mean
me to believe that you were concerned in
the robbery yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce flushed angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We knew Robin meant to take the
things—if she could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so. And you were willing to let
her do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was only a joke—another girl had
dared her to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you did not help in this very
peculiar species of joke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But we would have, if Robin had
wanted help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They had nothing whatever to do with
it, Miss Stone!” Robin interrupted, hotly.
“It was entirely my own affair. It’s quite
ridiculous for them to come in with me.
I’m the only one who should be punished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you realize that,” said Miss
Stone, smoothly. “Everyone who helped
to gorge upon what you stole is worthy of
punishment, and will certainly be dealt
with in due course; but you were evidently
the ringleader, as you have been so often
before in every kind of lawlessness. Since
your companions have chosen to burst into
my study with you they may remain to
hear what I have to say to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would send them away,”
muttered Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daresay you do. But it may hinder
them from following in your footsteps if
they are enabled to form a clear idea of
how such behaviour as yours is regarded
by people with ordinary ideas of honour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colour surged over Robin’s face,
and ebbed as quickly, leaving it very white.
Betty O’Hara uttered a choked exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Stone! Robin’s the honourablest
girl——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she?” Miss Stone smiled faintly. “I
fear that does not say much for the others—if
I accept your view, Betty. But then, I
do not.” She paused, and took off her
pince-nez as though fearing they might be
a handicap to her eloquence. Then, very
deliberately, she proceeded to avenge her
wrongs by dissecting Robin’s character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three who listened carried away no
very clear idea of the long oration that
followed. They heard the smooth voice
rising and falling in waves of scorn and
condemnation; but most of their attention
was centred on the white face of their companion,
who listened to the recital of her
own misdeeds in utter silence, infuriating
the principal by the shadow of a smile that
lurked about the corners of her mouth.
Miss Stone was a woman of an evil temper:
she had never liked Robin, and she had
chosen to consider herself humiliated. Now
she forgot that the girl before her was
little more than a child, and her anger grew
as she lashed her pitilessly with her tongue.
She searched an ample vocabulary for the
most stinging words: her voice was bitter
as she spoke of deceit, theft, dishonour,
meanness, greed. “If Robin had been a
murderess she couldn’t have been more
beastly,” said Annette, tearfully, later. And
Robin listened, and the little smile did not
fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not made up my mind whether
I can permit you to remain in the school,”
finished the principal, as breath began to
grow short. “The disgrace to your mother
weighs with me, of course, though I cannot
expect it to weigh with you: but I have to
consider your contaminating effect upon
my other pupils. For the present you will
remain entirely apart from the others,
studying, sleeping, and taking your meals
alone, and debarred from all games. Later
on——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a knock at the door. Eliza
entered, visibly nervous at finding herself
in the hall of justice, yet able to send a look
of sympathy at the criminal in the dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you I was not to be disturbed,
Eliza,” said Miss Stone, angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry ma’am. But it’s a telegram, and
it’s marked “Urgent.” So I thought I’d
better bring it in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Stone took the envelope from her
hand, and tore it open hastily. Her face
changed. She looked at Robin uncertainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This—this alters matters,” she said. “It
concerns you, Robin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the defiant carelessness died out of
Robin’s face. She sprang forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother!” she cried, and her voice was
a wail. “It isn’t Mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no. Not your Mother. She has
telegraphed for you to go home at once.
There is bad news for you, I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she is ill! Tell me, quickly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not your mother at all,” Miss
Stone answered. “It is your uncle. He—he
died yesterday, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin stared at her, helpless in her overwhelming
rush of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—Uncle Donald!” she said. She
gave a short laugh, and caught at Betty to
steady herself, forgetting Miss Stone altogether.
“I—I’m sorry—I didn’t mean to
laugh. But I thought it was Mother!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MERRI CREEK</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was late on the afternoon of the following
day when Robin Hurst changed from
the main line and entered the narrow-gauge
train which marked the final stage
of her journey home. The little line was a
new one, opening up a great stretch of
bush country that had hitherto been almost
unknown, save for scattered farms and
sawmills, where plucky settlers earned a
hard enough living among the giant hills.
Robin had not travelled on it before: it
was still under construction when she had
left home after the May holidays. She remembered
her drive to the station then,
over twelve miles of bad road, in torrents
of rain. She and her mother, half-smothered
in heavy black oilskins, had
tried to be merry as they urged the slow old
horse up and down the hills: she had a
sudden very vivid memory of her mother’s
face, still determinedly cheerful, when the
train that they had only just managed to
catch puffed out of the station. Mrs. Hurst
had stood on the platform, tall and erect,
the water dripping from her hat and coat,
and forming a widening pool round her: and
though her smile had been gay, Robin had
never forgotten the loneliness of her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she settled herself in the corner of
an empty carriage with an unwonted sense
of relief. She did not for a moment pretend
to herself that Uncle Donald’s death
caused her the slightest grief. He had
been her father’s brother, very much older
than the big, cheery red-haired father whose
death, three years before, had left his wife
and child alone and almost penniless. Until
then, their home had been in the Wimmera
district, and they had scarcely known
Donald Hurst: but when everything was
over, and he realized the helplessness of
their position, he had offered them a home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had taken it gratefully enough,
and through the years that followed they
had tried to please the hard old man: but
it had never been a happy home. Donald
Hurst’s wife had died many years before,
and there had been no children; he was
alone in the world, and he had asked nothing
better than to be alone. He lived in
a house much too big for him, with an old
housekeeper as hard and dour as himself,
and made the most of his small hill-farm;
it would not have been enough had he not
possessed a small private income as well.
At first Mrs. Hurst had tried to teach
Robin herself, for there was no school
within five miles. Then, realizing that the
girl was beyond her powers of teaching,
she had come to an arrangement with her
brother-in-law, by which she took the place
of the housekeeper, and with the money
thus saved he paid Robin’s expenses at a
school near Melbourne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very profitable arrangement for
Donald Hurst. The housekeeper had been
wasteful and lazy; had demanded high
wages and had cooked abominably. Now
he saved her wages and “keep,” as well as
that of Robin; and if he groaned heavily
over the school-bills, he knew well that he
was a gainer by the transaction. Mrs.
Hurst made his house run on oiled wheels:
his meals were better, his monthly store-accounts
less. Most of the house remained
shut up, but the rooms they occupied shone
with a cleanliness they had not known for
years. The old man chuckled in the depths
of his calculating old soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It pleased him, too, to be without Robin.
He hated all children, and Robin, with her
red hair and her overflowing high spirits,
reminded him sharply of the younger
brother he had never liked, and of whom
he had always been jealous. She was constantly
getting into trouble; it seemed almost
impossible for a day to pass without
a brush between her uncle and herself.
Robin had never known anything but
happiness. It puzzled her, and brought out
all that was worst in her nature, to be in a
house where there was no home-like atmosphere—where
grumbling and fault-finding
were perpetual. She grew reckless
and daring; dodging her uncle’s wrath
when she could, and bearing it with a careless
shrug when to dodge was impossible.
Even though losing Robin condemned her
mother to ceaseless loneliness she was
glad to see the child go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holidays had been rather more bearable,
although the long Christmas vacations had
strained endurance more than once to
breaking-point. Robin thought of them
now with a surge of dull anger against her
uncle that suddenly horrified her, seeing
that he was dead, and could trouble her no
more. How she and her mother had
longed for a tiny place just for themselves
during those precious weeks! Even a tent
in the bush would have been Paradise, compared
to the gloomy house where at any
time the loud, angry voice might break in
upon them with complaints and stupid
grumbling. And now it could never
happen any more. “I don’t care if it’s
wicked,” Robin muttered to herself. “He
was a bad old man, and I’m glad he’s
dead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train crawled slowly out of the
junction and wound its way between the
hills she knew. Robin looked out eagerly.
Below her wound the road over which she
had often travelled behind slow old Roany:
she could see that it had been made freshly,
most likely to assist in the construction of
the railway. Its smooth, well-rolled surface
struck an odd note, remembering what
seas of mud they had often ploughed
through on their journeys to the township.
Slow and toilsome as those drives had been,
she looked back to them as the brightest
parts of her holidays, since then they had
known that for hours they would be free
from Uncle Donald’s strident voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early September now. The winter
had been unusually mild and dry, and the
hills were gay with wattle-blossom, which
shone in dense masses of gold along the
line of the creek in the valley below. Already
the willows were budding: the sap,
racing through their limbs, turned them
to a coppery glow against the sunset.
“Early Nancy” starred the grass in the
cultivated fields with its myriad flowers:
Robin almost fancied she could smell their
faint, spicy fragrance. She longed to lie
in the deep, cool grass, forgetting the long
months of Melbourne dust and the school
that she had hated. Ayrshire cows, knee-deep
in marshy pools, glanced up lazily as
the train puffed by, too contented to allow
themselves to be disturbed: once a huge
bull stared defiantly, his great head thrust
forward, the sunlight rippling on his beautiful,
dappled brown and white coat. Robin
drew a long breath of utter happiness. Soon
she would be home: and there would be
mother waiting, and before them would
stretch the long, quiet evening, with no
harsh voice to mar its peace. Surely it was
not wicked to be glad!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually, as they left the township farther
and farther behind, the farms became
fewer and more isolated, giving place to
long stretches of rough hill-country. Here
there was little dairying land, and scarcely
any cultivation; the holdings were only partially
cleared, ring-barked timber standing
out, gaunt and grey, from the surrounding
undergrowth. There was evidence of the
ceaseless war against bracken fern and rabbits:
paddocks littered with dry, cut ferns
showed a fresh crop of green fronds starting
vigorously to replace them, and among
them were innumerable rabbit-burrows.
Already the evening was tempting their inhabitants
to appear: as the train came round
curves, a score of grey-brown bodies went
scurrying over the hillside, and a score of
white tails gleamed for an instant as their
owners dived into the safety of the underworld.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to a little siding presently, and
pulled up for a brief halt. There were no
station buildings: the tall timber came almost
to the railway line, save for a clearing
where a sawmill had established itself,
gaunt and hideous, with huge piles of giant
logs waiting their turn at the shrieking
saw, and great heaps of brown sawdust
bearing mute testimony to those which had
already met their fate. Now, freshly cut,
and still fragrant with resin and gum, they
waited for the trucks that should bear them
to Melbourne—stacks of smooth timber,
among which played the half-wild children
of the mill encampment. Here and there
were the tents of the workmen; their wives,
thin brown women, looking almost like men,
came hurrying out to greet the train that
made the great event of each day. The
guard flung upon the ground beside the line
the stores brought from the township: sacks
of bread, boxes of groceries, meat in blood-stained
bags. The children came running
to get them. Robin, leaning out, offered
them the remains of the fruit and sweets
the girls had packed into her travelling
basket that morning—pressing them into
grubby brown hands, whose owners hung
back, half-shy, wholly longing. Then the
engine-whistle made the hills echo, and the
little train drew away—to be swallowed
up in a moment by the tall trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a hint of dusk in the evening
sky when they drew into the terminus, a
tiny station in a more cleared area. Robin
had the door open before the train had come
to a standstill. There was the tall figure
waiting, just as she had dreamed—waiting
with her face alight with the joy of welcome.
Robin flung herself at her mother,
holding her with strong young arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother!—poor old Mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. I’m glad to have you!” breathed
Mrs. Hurst, with a deep sigh. “I had to
get you, Robin—I couldn’t wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think not! Has it been very
dreadful, Mother, darling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty dreadful.” The tall woman shuddered
slightly. “Never mind—I’ve got you
now. Let us get home as quickly as we
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were friendly hands to lift Robin’s
trunk into the battered old buggy outside
the station, and warm, kindly words of welcome;
all the farmers about Merri Creek
knew Mrs. Hurst and the long-legged, red-haired
girl who used to run wild over their
paddocks, and their wives had proved Alice
Hurst’s kindness in a hundred ways. They
looked at her this evening with an added
touch of respect and sympathy. Old Donald
Hurst’s rough nature had made him an unpopular
figure in the district, and the weary
life led with him by his sister-in-law was
no secret. They knew she had been a drudge,
unpaid save for her child’s school-fees; but
hard work was the daily portion of most of
the women of the bush. They pitied her,
not for that, but because of the ceaseless
bitterness of the old man’s tongue. It had
been no easy thing, to live upon his bounty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin and her mother climbed into the
buggy, said “Good-night,” and took the
road that wound along the valley. The
horse jogged slowly, and Mrs. Hurst let
him take his own pace. She drove with one
hand resting on Robin’s knee, apparently
unwilling to talk, only glad of her nearness;
and Robin, after one glance at her worn
face, was silent, too. They understood each
other very well. When Mother felt that
she could talk, Robin would be ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they turned in at the gate of Hill
Farm, it was almost dark. Roany jogged
more quickly up the track that led to the
stable-yard, where a big, awkward lad
waited, grinning cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ullo, Miss Robin! Glad to see y’
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, Danny!” Robin jumped out
lightly, and shook hands with him. “How
are all your people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-oh, thanks, Miss Robin. Jus’
you leave the ol’ horse to me, an’ I’ll bring
your box in presently. Kettle’s near
boilin’, Mrs. Hurst, an’ I lit the kitchen
lamp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very good of you, Danny.” Mrs.
Hurst’s voice was utterly weary, but she
forced a smile, and the big fellow beamed
in answer. Robin gathered her light
luggage, following her mother to the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kitchen was bright with lamp-light
and the glow of the fire. Robin put down
her burdens and went to her mother, taking
off her hat and coat as if she were a
child. Then she looked at her deliberately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you’re just dead-beat, Mummie!”
she said softly. She gathered the tall form
into her arms, holding her closely, patting
her with little loving touches; and Mrs.
Hurst put her head on the young shoulder,
and shook with sobs that had no tears. So
they stayed for a few moments. Then the
mother pulled herself together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it is just beautiful to feel you are
home!” she said. “Come to your room,
darling—you must be so hungry and tired.
Tea is all ready, except for the toast, and
that won’t take three minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t take you any time at all,” said
Robin, masterfully. “You’re going to do
as you’re told, for one night, anyhow, Mrs.
Hurst!” She led her into the dining-room,
and put her firmly on the couch: in spite of
her protests she took off her shoes, dashing
to her room for a pair of soft slippers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you just lie quiet,” she ordered, as
she lit the lamp. “Oh, you’ve got the fire
laid!—how ripping! It isn’t really cold,
but I’ll put a match to it, I think, don’t
you? a fire’s so cosy when you’re tired.
What a jolly tea, Mummie! that cake is
just an extra-special, and you had no business
to make it, but I’ll eat an awful lot.
Oh, and I’ve been getting into a most horrible
row over cakes!—they were cream-puffs,
and I’ll tell you all about them presently.
Feet warm?” She took off the
slippers and felt her mother’s feet, proceeding
to rub them vigorously. “They’re
just like frogs—when the fire burns up well
you’ll have to toast them; I’ll just get you
a rug for the present.” She covered her
gently, dropping a kiss on her forehead as
she straightened the rug. “Now, you lie
still and don’t argue—remember you’ve
got a daughter to bully you. I’ll have the
toast made in a jiffy. Shall I make Danny’s
tea in the little teapot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, please, darling,” said Mrs. Hurst,
smiling faintly. “But it’s too bad for you
to be working after your long journey. I
can quite well——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never saw such a woman to talk nonsense,”
said Robin. “Lie quiet, or I’ll have
to sit on you, and then we’ll never get tea—and
I’m so hungry!” She went swiftly
into the adjoining kitchen, leaving the
door open, and talking cheerfully while she
cut bread and poked the fire. “Isn’t it
splendid to have the railway at last! I was
quite thrilled to travel on it for the first
time, and to think how often we’d jogged
along that dreary old road. It’s so lovely
to be back, and to see hills and paddocks
again, after months of dingy grey streets:
and the wattle is just beautiful all the way
out. That you, Danny? come in. I’ll have
your tea ready in a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I put your things in your room, Miss
Robin,” Danny said. “Got plenty of wood?
I got a lot cut outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll want a big log for the dining-room
fire after tea, thanks, Danny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right-oh. I’ll go an’ ’ave a bit of a
wash.” He went out clumsily, and Robin
finished her preparations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” she said at length. “I’ll shut
the door, and we’ll be all cosy and comfortable.
I can hardly realize that I’m back,
unless I keep looking at you all the time!
Let me bring your tea to the couch, Mummie,
dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Hurst, with
decision. “I’m not so bad as that.” She
got up and came across to where Robin
stood, smiling down at her. “Let me wash
my hands, and I shall be able to enjoy the
luxury of sitting down with my daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only Miss Stone regarded me as you
do, how happy she might be!” remarked
Robin. “She has a total lack of appreciation
of my finer qualities.” Over their
meal she told her mother the harrowing
story of the cream-puffs, and had the satisfaction
of making her laugh more than
once. To anyone who knew Miss Stone
the mental vision of her plunging into Ruby
Bennett’s discarded delicacy was not without
humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t approve, of course,” said Mrs.
Hurst. “It was really naughty of you,
Robin, and you are old enough to know
better. But I think I can leave that part
of it to Miss Stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can, indeed,” Robin assured her.
“Her remarks left nothing to the imagination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I would have been distressed,
but nothing seems to matter much now,”
said her mother. “For school is over for
you, I’m afraid, dearest. You can never go
back to Calton Hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother! Say it again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it isn’t a joke, beloved,” said Mrs.
Hurst. “It is a great grief to me. You are
not sixteen: I had so hoped for two years
yet at school for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t be anything but a dunce if
I went to school for twenty years,” stated
her daughter, with shining eyes. “I know
enough now for life in the country, and
that’s what I’m always going to have. Oh,
Mother, I’m so glad! I’m sorry you aren’t,
but I can’t help it: I’m just glad all over!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped abruptly, looking at her
mother’s white face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you’re just going to lie down again
while I clear the table and wash up,” she
said. “Then I’ll put a big log on the fire,
and you’re going to tell me everything.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PLANS AND PROBLEMS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>There</span> isn’t so much to tell you,” Mrs.
Hurst said. The room was tidy, the kitchen
work done; Robin had made up the
fire and pulled her mother’s couch close to
it. She sat on the hearthrug near her; so
near that Mrs. Hurst could put out her
hand and touch the shining red hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know anything, you see,” Robin
answered. “Was he—was Uncle Donald
ill long, Mummie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only about ten days. He had been very
trying for over a month: his temper was
worse than ever, and nothing I could do
seemed to please him. I think the poor old
man must have been suffering, but he would
never tell me anything, and there were times
when I was almost in despair. Then one
night he would not eat, and when I took
him some nourishment after he had gone
to bed he flew into a violent passion and
shouted at me until even Danny woke and
came running to see what was the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin set her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I ought to be sorry that he’s
dead,” she said. “But I can’t be, Mother—I
just can’t. He was a bad, cruel old
man. That anyone should speak to you
like that—!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he was sorry afterwards. The
fit of anger ended in a violent coughing
attack, and at last he fainted. I sent Danny
to the village to telephone for the doctor,
but he was away in the hills and could not
get here until the next day, about noon, and
I had a terrible time trying to keep Uncle
Donald in bed: he would try to get up and
dress, but he always fainted. When the
doctor came he became more obedient. The
doctor told me from the first that there was
no hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have got me home,”
breathed Robin. She found her mother’s
hand and held it tightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst shuddered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not have had you here for anything.
He was very difficult to manage—his
temper seemed to get quite beyond his
control. And all the time he hated me,
Robin—he just hated me. You could see
it in every look he gave me, not only in the
bitter things he said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you had no help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried to get a nurse, but there were
none to be had. Some of the women about
here came when they could, and Danny
was a great comfort. There was really
very little to be done for the poor old man.
But it was a very heart-breaking thing to
see him dying like that—hating everyone,
and with his heart full of malice. Thank
God, at the last the evil spirit seemed to
leave him. For it really was an evil spirit,
Robin: something that seemed to take
possession of him, and to control his
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it left him?” said Robin, awed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-four hours before he died. He
woke up from a long sleep, very weak, but
quite rational and quiet. The first thing
he said was to tell me to get the lawyer out
from the township at once—Mr. Briggs.
Fortunately, Danny was able to get him on
the telephone and he came out in a car
immediately, with his clerk. Uncle Donald
got him to make his will, and they propped
him up while he signed it. It was all very
distressing, for he was so weak, and we
feared he might die at any moment. After
the business was done he seemed to grow
stronger, and talked to me quite kindly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad he did,” said Robin. “It would
have been awful if he had died in that
wicked mood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—it would have been terrible. He
said once, ‘You’ve been very kind to me,
Alice, and I’ve been very hard on you.’
And he asked me to forgive him—poor old
man! He seemed to want to have me with
him after that, and he liked me to hold his
hand. I was holding it when he died, very
early the next morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you had got me sooner,” said
Robin, very low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not want to get you until—until
everything was over. The funeral was
this morning. And after that I felt as if
I could hardly wait until you came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin put her cheek against the hand
she held, and for a while they were silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be just worn out, Mummie,”
the girl said, at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I shall be quite well in a few days.
I think I did not know how tired I was
until I saw you. Then I seemed to go all
to pieces.” She smiled at the bent head.
“It was feeling that I had someone to lean
upon, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’d better just lean hard,” said
Robin, sturdily. “You’re going to be an
invalid for a few days—I mean to keep
you in bed, and make you forget everything:
we’ve got such heaps to talk about.
Mummie, are we going to be very poor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you afraid of being poor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit. We’ve never been anything
else, have we? As long as we are together
I don’t mind anything at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall be very poor, my girl. Uncle
Donald left me all he had, but it is not
much. Most of his income came from
money he had sunk in an annuity, and that,
of course, died with him. The farm is not
valuable. I consulted Mr. Briggs about
selling it, but he thinks there would be no
chance of that, and that we should get very
little, even if we were able to sell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we can’t work it, can we? I’ll do
anything in the world to help, Mummie,
but I know two women can’t run the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we couldn’t possibly work it; even
if we employed a man it could hardly be
carried on, and wages and keep would eat
up the profits. Properties are hard to sell
just now, Mr. Briggs says; people are
afraid of the difficult life on the hill farms,
with the constant struggle against rabbits
and bracken. He thinks he could let the
land to one of the neighbours: the Merritts
need more land, he says, now that the railway
has come and they can get their produce
away more easily. He advises us to
let the paddocks, retaining the house and
the few acres round it. With very great
care I think we could live on the income
we should get. But it would mean looking
at every penny twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know best, Mother, darling.
What could we do if we didn’t let the land
to Mr. Merritt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we have very little choice. Selling
is out of the question, for the present, at
any rate. We might try to let the whole
property, with the house; if we could do
that I might get some work in Melbourne
that would add to our income. But work
is hard to get, for anyone of my age; and I
should hardly know what to do with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that’s a perfectly hateful idea!”
Robin sat up with a jerk. “You mean to
go slaving in some beastly shop or office,
I suppose—wearing yourself out altogether!
Don’t you think we could manage to stay
on here, Mother? We could live on awfully
little—I can shoot rabbits and catch
fish, and we hardly need any clothes out
in this lonely place! And it would be so
lovely to be together again—just you and
I. You know how we used to ache to be
by ourselves somewhere, in the holidays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think I don’t want it as much
as you do? I have thought of nothing else.
Oh, I think we may venture to try it, Robin—even
if it were only for a year or two.
I wouldn’t want you to stay here too long:
when you are eighteen I should like you to
learn typewriting and shorthand, so that
you would have a profession to fall back
upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t seem to care what we do in a
couple of years,” Robin said, laughing.
“But at present I want to stay here, in this
jolly old place, and feel that it’s our very
own, and that no one can turn us out of
it. It <span class='it'>is</span> such a dear old house, and we
could make it so pretty. We’ll have a
scrumptious garden, Mummie: I can do the
digging, and you’ll supply the brains. I
don’t see why we shouldn’t sell vegetables,
because of course we can never eat all we
grow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That might be an idea,” said Mrs.
Hurst, thoughtfully. “Now that the railway
is here it would be easy to send fresh
vegetables into Baroin once a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll make heaps of money,” said
Robin, with the gay confidence of nearly
sixteen. “And rabbits, Mummie—isn’t it
a mercy that Father taught me to shoot,
and that we have his gun? Nice young
bunnies ought to be very saleable—and
think of the skins! they are worth ever so
much. Danny can teach me to prepare
them. We’ll have to do without Danny. I
suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—we have no chance of keeping a
boy. The cows must be sold. I thought we
would keep the little Jersey: she has a
beautiful calf a week old. She will give
us more butter than we need, but I can sell
it at the store in the village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can milk her,” said Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be my job,” said her mother,
with firmness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, if you get there first!” rejoined
Robin politely. They laughed at
each other, and Mrs. Hurst gave a great
sigh of happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if you knew what a difference it
makes to have you!” she said. “Everything
looked black to me, and I was sure I could
not manage to make both ends meet. And
I’m not sure now: we are certain to have
a hard struggle, with plenty of anxiety
and care, but nothing seems to matter so
much now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how anything <span class='it'>can</span> matter
much, if we are together,” said Robin,
simply. “We’re both strong—at least you
will be after you have had a good rest—and
you’re nearly as young as I am—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robin, what nonsense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, you are—you know Father
married you and ran away with you when
you hardly had your hair up! and you’ll
grow younger every year, because we’re
going to make a joke of everything, and
there will be no one to be cross with you
any more. At least, I shall be very cross
with you if you try to do foolish things
like milking cows—but you’ll soon learn
that it isn’t safe! And everything will be
tremendous fun, even if we have to live on
turnips and buttermilk. I think we’re the
luckiest people that ever owned a farm!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I am a very lucky mother,” Mrs.
Hurst said, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, Miss Stone wouldn’t tell you
so. Mother, darling, I’ve come home with
a horribly bad character—Miss Stone
thinks I’m absolutely no good in the world.
I was always getting into scrapes and sinking
lower and lower in the form. I didn’t
mean to be so hopeless; but I seemed to get
into rows without any effort on my part,
and at last I just didn’t care. I’m awfully
sorry now, ’cause of you. But it really
isn’t a school that makes you proud of it,
and no one trusts Miss Stone. I’m just
glad all over that I need never see her
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do the girls trust you?” Mrs. Hurst
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin’s head went up, and she coloured
hotly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, shortly. “They know
they can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I am not going to let Miss Stone’s
report worry me,” said her mother. “I’m
sorry you have got into trouble, and I wish
you had worked better, especially as you
have no more chances of learning. But
you and I are facing the real things of life
now, and school scrapes, big as they seem
at the moment, will soon be forgotten.
We’re partners, my daughter, and we have
to trust each other in all things, and work
together.” She sighed. “I do hope it won’t
mean that you will get none of the joy of
life while you are young. I had always
hoped to be able to give you a good time—such
a time as I had myself before Father,
as you say ‘married me and ran away with
me’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin hugged her enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you only knew how I’m loving the
bare idea of being partners!” she exclaimed.
“I never dared to hope for anything so
lovely: all the way in the train, even when
I ached with joy at seeing the country, I
was aching in a different way at the
thought of going back to school! I’d never
have done any good there, Mummie—you
don’t know how hopeless it was. Now
we’ll be working together, in our own
home, and sharing everything. I’m blessed
if I want more joy of life than that is going
to mean!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat back on her heels, the firelight
dancing on her vivid face and her mop of
red hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to think,” she chanted, “that
they’ll be getting up in the morning at the
sound of the same old bell, and ploughing
through the same old stodgy lessons all
day, and eating the same old awful meals,
and walking in the same old crocodile down
the same old dusty streets! And I’m free
and independent and here——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milking the same old cow!” laughed
her mother—looking suddenly as young
as she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the same old cow-bail,” Robin
flashed back. “And I wouldn’t change my
job for all the tea in China!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TWO MONTHS LATER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Robin Hurst</span> came out upon the veranda
of Hill Farm in the early dawn. It was
an exquisite November morning. Mists
were rising slowly from the gullies, revealing
the tops of giant tree-ferns; above
them, invisible in tree-tops still shrouded in
white clouds, cockatoos shrieked a morning
chorus. A pair of kookaburras perched
on the gate-posts and looked wisely at
Robin: they were old friends, christened
Sally and Sam, so tame that they came
regularly to find the scraps of raw meat
that she left for them whenever meat occurred
in the Hurst household—which was
not every day. They preened their feathers,
puffing them out until they looked
ridiculously fat, the first sunbeams making
them glint with a metallic blue and bronze.
Then they broke into a wild duet of laughter.
The echoes ran round the hills, “Ha-ha-ha!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!” and were answered
by other kookaburras beyond the creek.
Robin put her head back and imitated the
call—a proceeding that always puzzled and
delighted Sally and Sam, who waited
politely until she had finished, and then
laughed as if it were the best joke in the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin waved her hand to the cheerful
pair, and went off round the house—a
workmanlike figure in blue shirt and khaki
breeches, finished with home-made leggings
of khaki cloth. From the first she had
discarded skirts for country wear; and
fortunately, Mrs. Hurst had put by a stock
of breeches belonging to her husband, which
her nimble fingers had altered to suit
Robin’s requirements. The Jersey cow was
waiting near the shed, where a shining
bucket was up-ended on a rough bench,
beside a three-legged stool. Robin petted
her for a moment, and then sat down in
the open to milk her—there was no need
now to affront Bessy with the indignity
of a bail. This done, she fed her, gave
breakfast to Daisy, the calf, and to two
small pigs that roamed at will in a tiny
paddock; and, taking a hoe, went off to the
vegetable garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything was very neat about the Hill
Farm house. In front was a rambling old
garden, ablaze with flowers. A trimly-cut
lawn, shaded on the west by a row of
Cootamundra wattles, took up much of the
space; and there were winding walks and
cool, quiet nooks where rustic seats invited
you to sit down and rest, looking
down the smooth green slopes towards the
creek. Creeping plants and climbing roses
made the wide verandas into bowers of
scented bloom. Beyond the well-kept back
yard came the vegetable garden, the pride
of Robin’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Danny had dug the garden for Robin,
refusing any payment. It was, indeed,
difficult to exclude Danny from Hill Farm:
the fact that he was supposed to be working
for his father did not prevent him
from appearing at odd moments, not at
the house itself, but wherever any job
waited that required extra muscle. Thus,
Robin would find the cow-yard or pigsty
swept and garnished: a heap of wood split
and stacked, or a broken fence mended.
“Aw, I just gotta spare hour an’ nothin’ to
do in it,” Danny would say, bashfully. It
was evident that he still looked on the
Hursts as his responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst worried over the fact that
it was impossible to make him take any
money—the mere mention of which threw
Danny into painful embarrassment. She
consoled herself by knitting him socks, and
by keeping on hand a stock of the brown
gingerbread that never failed to delight
him. Danny regarded himself as the
guardian of the family, and would have
been content with his position without
either gingerbread or socks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vegetables stretched in neat rows,
and, to Robin’s mind, represented unlimited
wealth. The season had been kind
to her: rain had come just when it was
needed, and everything had flourished
amazingly in the rich virgin soil. Long
lines of potatoes were in flower: peas,
beans, turnips, and all their brethren made
a heartsome sight; and there was a little
corner Robin loved, where thyme, sage,
marjoram and parsley lent their old-world
sweetness. Not a weed was to be seen anywhere.
Daily the gardener made her way,
hoe in hand, up and down each row; and
in face of this martial pilgrimage no weed
dared lift its head. Robin declared that
her motto was, “A hoe in time saves nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already she had preparations in train
for disposing of her crop. Baroin boasted
a good greengrocer’s shop, and Robin had
made friends with its proprietress, who
had agreed to take a weekly supply of
vegetables from her as soon as they were
ready. Eggs and chickens were to be a
side-line. In a netted pen a dozen cockerels
fattened in happy ignorance of the advance
of Christmas, while three or four broods
of fluffy chicks roamed the hillside beside
their fussy mothers, and young ducklings
swam gaily in the creek. Robin yarded
them all carefully every evening, for there
were many foxes in the bush, a terror to
every country poultry-yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The months since the death of her
uncle had been, for her mother and herself,
a time of absolute happiness. They were
busy, but never oppressed with work. The
house was much too large for them, but
most of the rooms had been shut up, after
undergoing a rigorous spring-cleaning.
They slept on the veranda, and took most
of their meals there; the bathroom served
them as dressing-room, so that housework
was reduced to its lowest possible terms,
since there was no dust and no one to make
the place disorderly. Together they worked
in the garden, kept everything spick-and-span,
and made a joke of each hour’s toil
as it came. There was time for play, too:
they fished in the creek for trout and blackfish,
and took long walks over the hills,
where many a rabbit fell to Robin’s gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peaceful, happy life had wrought
a great change in Mrs. Hurst. She looked
years younger already: there was a new
light in her eyes, a new energy in her
movements. Colour had returned to her
white face, and wrinkles had vanished.
Robin was desperately proud of her.
“When I make you wear breeches like me
and have your hair shingled,” she declared,
“everyone will think you’re my young
sister!” To which Mrs. Hurst responded
that she preferred the dignity of age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell rang just as Robin reached the
end of her last row of peas, and she fled
to answer it with a haste that proclaimed
hunger. When, after washing her hands,
she appeared on the veranda, Mrs. Hurst
was waiting for her. Robin attacked her
porridge and cream ravenously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a good thing you brought me
up not to take sugar with porridge?” she
remarked. “Sugar costs a lot of money,
and we can’t possibly grow it ourselves.
The girls at school used to think me perfectly
mad when I said they turned their
porridge into a pudding. Oh, I am hungry,
Mummie, and the runner beans are up, and
I got three weeds. Small weeds, but healthy.
We can have radishes for tea to-night.
More, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst disentangled these mingled
confidences with the calmness of long
practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My phlox seeds are up, too,” she said.
“What wouldn’t come up, in weather like
this? Finish the cream, darling: I don’t
want any more. I’ve made the butter, and
there will be three pounds to take down to
the store. Bessy is behaving nobly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin let the thick yellow cream trickle
slowly over her porridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, isn’t she? Mr. Merritt was a
brick to let us graze Bessy and Roany in
the creek paddock—poor dears, they’re so
used to it that they would have hated to be
the wrong side of the fence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means a great deal to us,” Mrs.
Hurst remarked. “Mr. Merritt is very kind:
he said he would use Roany occasionally,
to pay for their grazing, but I don’t think
he has had him in the plough three times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and it would really be better for
Roany if he did use him—Roany is getting
disgracefully fat and lazy. I think he’d
be frisky if it weren’t so much bother.
What is the heavenly aroma of cooking,
Mummie?—you haven’t been extravagant,
have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only potato-puffs,” said Mrs. Hurst,
emerging from the kitchen with a covered
dish. “You were up so early, Robin, and
you really need a good breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always have a good breakfast,” stated
her daughter. “Catch me going without!
But those puffs are awfully exciting, Mummie.”
She gazed fondly at the crisp golden
balls as they smoked on her plate. “I wish
I could fry things like you. No, not like
you—you know what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you will, when you have a little
more practice. You are doing very well
as a cook. What are your plans for this
morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to finish painting the front
fence. I thought one coat would be
enough, but it would be a better job with
two. Isn’t it a mercy Uncle Donald bought
paint by the gallon? I’ve enough to do ever
so much more. What are you going to
do, Mummie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mend sheets—there is a pile waiting
for me. I think you had better go to the
store with the butter after lunch, Robin—if
you take your gun you may get some
rabbits, coming home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good idea,” agreed Robin.
“Won’t you come, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not to-day—I want to get all the
mending out of the way when once I begin
it. Replacing house-linen will be an expensive
matter: we can’t afford to let
things go at all.” A faint line appeared
between her brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you’re worrying about money
again, Mummie. And you promised you
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do try not to worry,” said her mother.
“Now and then I can’t help it, especially
when I wake up at night. If I could only
get a little reserve in the bank, Robin—something
against a rainy day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the rainy day may never come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s far less likely to come if one has
something in the bank. I don’t know why,
but it is so. We did save a little, and then
my horrible dentist’s bill ate it all up. The
idea of illness makes me afraid—supposing
I fell ill, and you all alone here, without
money!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you aren’t feeling ill, Mother?”
demanded Robin, anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—not a bit. But it may come.” She
laughed at the worried face. “I really
didn’t mean to talk like this; but I had a
wakeful night, and all sorts of bogies came
and sat on my pillow. I would do anything
if I could earn some money—something to
put by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how we can do more than
we’re doing,” Robin said, knitting her
brows. “Remember, the vegetable money
will begin to come in soon, and I’ve quite
a lot of rabbit skins, already. Oh, I’m sure
we’ll manage quite well, darling!” She
went to her mother, putting her lips to her
hair. “If you begin to worry, things will
be sure to go wrong. And we’re so happy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed we are,” said her mother,
holding her closely for a moment. “Well,
I will try to scare the bogies away from
my pillow; and after all, there is nothing
like happiness for that. Come and help
me to clear up the kitchen—we’re being
disgracefully idle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her sewing-machine was humming
steadily when Robin passed the window an
hour later—a truly remarkable figure in
blue denim overalls that had belonged to
the late Mr. Donald Hurst. They came to
her insteps, ending in an artistic fringe
where superfluous length had been ruthlessly
shorn. She wore an old felt hat
which had also been the property of her
uncle. It was an outfit reserved for painting;
many white splashes testified to the
fact that its use was no unnecessary precaution.
She carried a can of paint and a
large brush, and sang cheerfully as she
went. The strains of “Why Did I Kiss
That Girl?” mingled with the chatter of
cockatoos in the tree-tops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst looked, and smiled, and
sighed. There was no doubt that Robin
asked nothing better than her present existence.
She seemed to have put away all
the childish irresponsibility that had made
her school career a series of mad pranks,
throwing herself into her unaccustomed
work with whole-hearted vigour and complete
happiness. But it was more a boy’s
life than a girl’s—not the life that Mrs.
Hurst had longed to give her. And there
was no prospect of anything better.
Money anxieties were not the only bogies
that had disturbed the mother’s pillow in
the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin was blissfully unconscious of any
troubling thoughts. She painted all the
morning, using her brush with a fine slap-dash
effect that bespattered her overalls
even more generously. The spirit of the
late Mr. Hurst might have writhed to see
the lavishness with which his paint was
used. The job was nearly done when Mrs.
Hurst came out to warn her that dinner
was almost ready. The fence gleamed
white against the deep green of the garden,
and Robin was by the gate, marking
a board “Wet Paint” in letters large
enough to warn the most unwary trespasser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just done,” she said, gaily. “Doesn’t
it look scumptious, Mother? I think I’ll
paint the side-fences, too: it would give the
place an almost regal effect, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s always the way,” Mrs. Hurst said,
shaking her head with affected gloom. “I
have known many other cases.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cases of what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paint-fever. You might call it paintitis.
They’re very painful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you say paint-ful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agonizing was what I said, I think.
The patient begins by painting a curtain-rod,
or a book-rack, and that leads to the
kitchen-chairs, and then to a garden-fence.
After that, she can’t stop. Everything
she sees presents itself in a new
light—something to be painted. The
worst cases go on to decorate the Jersey
cow, and the horse, and the pigs. They
brighten a property very much, but they’re
expensive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This case has already painted her uncle’s
pants, and she’ll paint the house red if she
doesn’t soon get dinner!” laughed Robin.
“Come home—it’s horrid of you to jeer
at my artistic instincts, just as they’re developing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was indeed, and I think the fence is
beautiful,” said her mother. “And yes, I
do believe it would look better if it were
done all round. Robin, our little home
is beginning to do us credit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it?” agreed Robin, looking affectionately
at the white cottage nestling in
its girdle of blossoming garden. “What a
pity it is we can’t fill it up with poor youngsters
who never see anything but streets.
How I do hate streets! Tell you what,
Mummie, when I find a gold-mine in the
hills——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>When</span> you do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course I’m going to—the kind
all stiff with nuggets, like plums in a pudding!
Then we’ll get little convalescents
from the Children’s Hospital and put them
in all the empty rooms. Plenty of blankets,
aren’t there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty—not that that need trouble you
when you have the plum-pudding gold-mine!”
said her mother laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course—I forgot that. Well,
I’ll buy eiderdown quilts. And we’ll give
them all a glorious time. Isn’t it a jolly
idea, Mummie! I have heaps of ideas like
that while I’m working, and even if they
never come to pass I’ll have had all the
fun of planning them. They taught me at
school that ‘to travel hopefully was a
better thing than to arrive,’ or something
like that. Well, I haven’t done much arriving
yet, but there’s a lot of fun in travelling
hopefully!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst looked at the eager, merry
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are certainly a hopeful traveller
for one’s journey-mate,” she said. “And
now, I am going to give orders, for once.
I have sat still almost all the morning, and
need exercise, whereas you have worked
since sunrise without a break—and that is
not good for young muscles. You
will therefore take a book out to your bed
on the veranda and lie down for at least
two hours——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And leave you to wash up! Not if I
know it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To please me, Robin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They smiled at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have to go to the store with the
butter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half-past three or four o’clock will be
quite time enough for that. You know
quite well that you won’t get rabbits early
in the afternoon. Run away and get your
boots off; I shall begin to be worried if
you are not lying down in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin stood up, conscious that her
shoulders ached badly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll go, because you are mean
enough to appeal to my better nature,” she
said, laughing. “But lie down, yourself, for
a bit, Mummie, darling—you won’t work
at that old machine all day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well—I promise, if you will do as
you are told.” She began to gather plates
and dishes swiftly, and Robin went with
an unwilling step. But when her mother
came softly to the veranda, half an hour
later, her book had fallen beside the bed,
and Robin lay with her cheek upon her
hand, fast asleep.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ROBIN FINDS STRANDED WAYFARERS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>A big</span> grey touring-car came slowly along
the narrow track, feeling its way round
blind corners and hairpin bends. It was
not a pleasant road for touring, especially
to people accustomed only to the smoothness
and width of city streets. The road
that led out from Baroin had been metalled
for only part of its length: after five or six
miles, winter had put a stop to road-making,
and the good surface ceased
abruptly. Then with each mile as it wound
into the hills, the track grew worse. It
clung to the steep sides of the rises, a grey
ribbon undulating between walls of bracken
fern, barely wide enough, in many places,
to carry a car: above it the sheer rise:
below, a drop of anything from ten to a
hundred feet. Sometimes the trees near
it had been cleared: more often, they
crowded it on both sides, so that the road
ran between walls of slender trunks and
tossing tree-tops. This gave variety,
because any turn might reveal a tree across
the track. On the other hand, the trunks
might catch a car that went over the side—a
helpful possibility, at the narrowest
bends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One drove along the hill-road, hoping
earnestly that one would not meet any
other vehicle. Should this occur, the proceedings
were slow and complicated. A
jinker, or a light cart, was nothing, provided
the horse did not play up: the steed
could be taken out of the shafts and the
cart backed until a space was reached wide
enough to allow of passing: which might
not be for a mile, or perhaps two. Still,
it was simple. More harrowing were the
times when one motor encountered another,
or a team of twelve or fourteen bullocks
dragging a heavy waggon. Then might
be seen the spectacle of a car feeling its
way painfully in reverse gear, along the
way it had come—a way sufficiently exciting
to drive on the forward journey.
Nervous passengers were wont to get out
and walk. Pitt-street and Collins-street
may have their terrors for the motorist,
but they lack the thrills provided by a
Gippsland track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To avoid, so far as might be possible,
the dangers of these untoward meetings,
the grey touring-car crawled like a snail
round bends, and made haste where haste
did not seem suicidal. Its driver was a
middle-aged man, tanned and weather-beaten,
whose ordinarily cheerful face was
set, just now, in anxious lines. His wife
sat beside him, little, and plump, and pretty.
She said nothing, but occasionally emitted
short gasps of horror. To ease her feelings—it
was clear that she did not ease
those of her husband—she leaned forward
constantly and pressed the button of the
horn, so that their advance was preluded
by a succession of piercing shrieks.
Occasionally the driver said patiently, “I
wish you wouldn’t, Milly.” To which she
invariably responded:—“But you mustn’t
take a single finger from the wheel, dear,
and somebody <span class='it'>must</span> hoot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third member of the party occupied
the back seat, amid a litter of luncheon-baskets,
cushions, rugs, and fishing-rods.
He was a thick-set boy of fifteen, whose
dark face betrayed nothing but boredom
with his surroundings. The bush through
which they travelled did not interest him;
a motor-car was, in his view, a means of
moving swiftly through space, and to
crawl along a mountain track at the pace
of a bullock-waggon failed to appeal to him
in the least. His mother’s nervous gasps
moved him only to faint scorn. Finally he
produced a paper-covered book from his
pocket, and became lost in its pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fate contrived to make Mrs. Edward
Lane press unusually hard on the button
after a period of silence very grateful to
her husband’s nerves. The ear-splitting
hoot that ensued made him swerve a few
inches—at a spot where there was, unfortunately,
not an inch to spare. The bracken,
growing thickly from below, hid the fact
that the edge of the track had broken off.
Bracken, however thick, cannot support the
weight of a six-cylinder car. There was a
moment’s sick suspense as the big Buick
toppled sideways, slid for a few yards, and
came to rest, wedged against a huge tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lane shot head-first over the edge,
landing in a patch of fern, while her husband
and son saved themselves in some
miraculous fashion. The bottom of the car
received them, amid the flying pieces of
the shattered windscreen. Considerably
astonished at finding themselves alive,
they climbed out and hurried to the assistance
of the lady of the party, who sat among
the ferns, holding her ankle. She had taken
her own meteoric flight in silence, but she
screamed as she saw their faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re hurt!” she cried. “Barry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only scratches, Mother,” said Barry
Lane, gruffly, his face white under streaks
of blood. “Are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned back against her husband’s
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My ankle,” she said. “Something has
happened to it. But not much, I think.
Are you sure you are not injured, Edward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite sure, dear—just scratches and
bruises.” He felt her ankle tenderly, while
she winced. “No bone broken, thank
goodness! Sure you’re all right, Barry-boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” said Barry. “A bit of glass
just missed my eye—luck, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, if neither of you are hurt, I’m
glad the suspense is over,” declared Mrs.
Lane, with surprising energy. “I knew it
had to come, only I was sure it would be
where there was a clear drop of half a mile!
Now it’s happened, and we’re all alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like your philosophy,” said her husband.
“It doesn’t deal with the problem
of how we’re to get out of this outlandish
place, with a damaged car, I suppose?” He
was removing her shoe and stocking with
deft fingers as he spoke. “Only a bad
sprain—poor little woman! Are you perfectly
certain you are not hiding anything
else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a thing,” she assured him, hastily.
“I’m scratched, of course, but who wouldn’t
be? bracken is such scratchy stuff. Just
fancy, if there had been a log in it, what
a bump I would have come! And how is
the poor car?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll look presently. Barry, get the
table-napkins out of the lunch-baskets and
climb down to the creek—soak them well,
and bring them back as quickly as you can.
That’s the best we can do for the ankle
until we can find a house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry dived at the car and in a moment
was plunging down the hillside. Dr. Lane
took out a pocket-flask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink this,” he said, giving her the
little silver cup. “No, I don’t care if you
don’t want it—you’re to have it, Milly.
There’s a certain amount of shock about a
tumble like this, even if we do happen to
be all alive. I’m going to have a drink
myself. Now I’ll make you a bit more
comfortable.” He salvaged a rug from the
car, folded it, and arranged it so that she
could sit on it, leaning back against a tree:
and lifting her as if she were a child, placed
her upon it, with a cushion behind her and
another supporting the injured foot. Barry
returned, panting, with a handful of
dripping table-napkins, with which his
father bandaged the ankle scientifically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s ever so much easier,” said Mrs.
Lane, smiling at their concerned faces.
“How wise it is to take a doctor when one
goes for hair-raising trips!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we’d taken an ambulance as
well!” said her husband drily. “But we’ll
get help somewhere. Now, let’s have a look
at the car, Barry. You might have washed
your face when you were at the creek!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t time,” said Barry, with a grin.
He was poking round the car, pulling away
the undergrowth into which it had settled.
“I say, Father, she hasn’t come off too
badly, I believe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think not—thanks to that providential
tree. We should all have been
mince-meat, but for it. One wheel is hopeless,
of course, and the petrol-tank is badly
bashed—but I don’t think there’s much
wrong with the engine. Stout old car, and
no mistake. But getting her up will be no
end of a job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, these country people make a regular
living from hauling damaged cars out
of difficulties,” said Barry, with the air of
a man of the world. “A fellow at school
says there’s one place on the Prince’s
Highway where the people water the road
regularly every night, and keep a team of
bullocks handy to pull the cars out of the
mud-holes next day! I expect we’ll have
the kindly natives along presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Lane glanced up, and whistled softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s the first native, and armed
to the teeth, too!” he remarked. “But she
doesn’t look as if she could do much pulling,
I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she’s found game, so we shan’t
starve,” Barry chuckled. “Talk about
ginger hair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin, bare-headed, was coming along
the track above them—a sufficiently unexpected
figure in her blue shirt and khaki
breeches, with her red mane glinting in the
sun. She carried her gun over her
shoulder: a pair of rabbits dangled limply
from her hand. Just as the boy spoke she
caught sight of them and stopped in amazement.
Then she put her gun against the
hillside, dropped the rabbits, and plunged
down towards them.</p>

<p class='caption'>“Is anyone hurt?”</p>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anyone hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not badly,” Dr. Lane said, taking off
his hat. “But we’re pretty well stranded,
as you may see, and my wife has sprained
her ankle. Can you tell me where is the
nearest township?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merri Creek is nearest, but it is only
a village—one store and a blacksmith’s
shop. You’re more than twelve miles from
Baroin. That is the only place where there
is a garage—and a doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The garage interests me most—I
happen to be a doctor myself,” he said,
smiling at her. “We are staying at the
hotel at Baroin; we came out this way for
a day’s fishing. Twelve miles—h’m! It’s
a long way at this time of the evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merri Creek has a telephone; you could
easily get help for the car to-morrow,” said
Robin. She was thinking rapidly, her
thoughts running upon the state of the
larder at Hill Farm. She remembered the
rabbits with a throb of relief. “And there’s
bacon and eggs,” she murmured, half aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon?” said Dr. Lane,
staring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only pondering ways and means,”
she said. “You must come to our house,
of course; it isn’t more than a mile away.
My mother will be very glad to do all she
can for you. I can run home and bring
our horse and buggy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it a quiet horse?” spoke Mrs. Lane,
for the first time. “I do hope it is really
quiet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin laughed outright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you see Roany you won’t be
anxious,” she said. “He’s long past his
wild youth. The difficulty is to make him
raise anything but a jog!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just the kind of horse I like,”
Mrs. Lane answered, with a sigh of relief.
“But are you sure we shan’t be putting your
people to horrible inconvenience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is only mother and I,” Robin said.
“And we have plenty of room. Mother
wouldn’t dream of letting you go anywhere
else. Indeed, there isn’t anywhere to go—ours
is the only house near the road.” She
turned, and went up the hillside lightly.
From the road she hailed them again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I bring back anything to make the
hurt ankle comfortable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s well bandaged with table-napkins,
thank you,” Dr. Lane answered. “I think
it will be all right until we get to your
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a lass with a head on her
shoulders,” he remarked, as Robin gathered
up her gun and her rabbits and disappeared
round a bend in the track. “We’re in luck’s
way, I fancy. One would not expect to meet
a girl of her type in this wild place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was picturing spending the night in a
splitter’s camp—and glad to get there,” his
wife answered. “She looked so nice and
clean—far cleaner than I feel! I wonder
what the house will be like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s any port in a storm for us to-night,”
said Dr. Lane, regarding the wreck of his
car ruefully. “Merri Creek must be that
little place we saw below us a mile back—the
railway terminus. It wouldn’t be a bad
idea, Barry, if you got down there and
telephoned to the hotel. Tell them to send
out things for the night—your mother
might as well be comfortable. If you
explain what has happened they can send
them with a car from the garage, and the
garage people can size up the damage of
the Buick, and see how we’re to get her in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right-oh!” said Barry. “But I say—we
don’t know the name of the people here.
How am I to tell them where to send?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove! I never thought of that,” his
father said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just ask the people at Merri Creek,”
said Mrs. Lane, practically. “I’m certain
there can’t be two girls with hair like that
walking round these hills in breeches! If
you describe her, they will be sure to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if a car comes out,” said Barry,
“why shouldn’t we go back to Baroin in
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because your mother isn’t going to drive
twelve miles over these tracks after being
shot out once,” said Dr. Lane, concisely.
“Hurry up, or they’ll never get here before
dark.” And Barry went off, wishing that
he had a chance of washing his face, on
which the blood had dried uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a long while before they heard
the rattle of buggy-wheels and saw Robin
driving along the track. She greeted them
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to drive on a little way,” she
called: “there’s no room to turn here. I
won’t be more than a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I may as well get you up to the
track,” said Dr. Lane to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not an easy business: both were
panting, and Mrs. Lane’s face was very
white, when Robin reappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother put a mattress on the floor of
the buggy,” she said. “This is what we call
an express-waggon, and there’s lots of room
behind; Mother said it would be more comfortable
than sitting on the seat, with your
foot hanging down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother’s a wise woman,” said
Dr. Lane, thankfully. He braced his
muscles, and lifted his wife into the back of
the buggy, where she sat enthroned upon
the mattress with the injured foot sticking
out stiffly, and declared that she was perfectly
comfortable—a manifest untruth,
which impressed neither of her hearers.
They unloaded the car of all that was portable,
and Dr. Lane climbed up beside Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready?” she asked. “Oh—where’s the
boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has gone to telephone from Merri
Creek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he won’t know where to come
afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy he’ll find his way—Barry generally
gets where he wants to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had better drive back for him after I
land you at home,” said Robin, without
enthusiasm—visions crossing her mind of
evening duties among the live stock. There
was milking to be done, animals to be fed
and poultry to be housed for the night. She
had no mind to risk her ducklings among
the foxes for the sake of a boy who had
looked distinctly cross. Then she remembered
his blood-smeared face and mentally
rebuked herself for being a pig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No need for that, I think,” Dr. Lane
was saying, pleasantly. “I can drive back,
when I get Mrs. Lane to bed, if you will be
kind enough to let me have the trap—I’ll
promise not to send it over the edge, as I
did the car!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin brightened visibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly you can,” she said. “Old
Roany will take you safely over any of
these tracks—they’re really not fit for
cars.” They jogged peacefully homewards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope I’m not jolting you very badly;”
she said, presently, turning to look at the
passenger in the rear. “The road isn’t wide
enough to dodge the holes—I can only go
slowly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m quite enjoying myself,” said the
lady on the mattress. “Only, I want to
be introduced, because you aren’t a bit
what we expected to meet in the country!
Our name is Lane, and we came from Melbourne
yesterday for a holiday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Robin Hurst,” the girl told her,
smiling down at the pretty face. “Mother
and I live at Hill Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you haven’t always lived here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no. But I hope we’re always going
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me!” said Mrs. Lane, weakly.
“It seems a strange hope!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin laughed softly. Dr. Lane decided
that he liked the sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have had an unlucky beginning,”
she said. “It really isn’t fair to judge our
country when you try to kill yourself on
the very first day. Wait until you see the
bush in the early morning, before the mists
rise—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” said Mrs. Lane, firmly. “I
dislike seeing anything before breakfast—and
not too soon after! I like well-paved
streets, without precipices, nicely furnished
with electric trams. I can’t see any fun
whatever in driving along a mantelshelf on
the side of a hill. It makes me afraid: and
it is so lowering to one’s pride to feel
afraid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if, before you had the shelf on the
side of the hill, you had no road at all, you
would look at it differently,” said Robin,
laughing. “We regard our road with
respect and affection—especially the
metalled part!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a metalled part?” queried Mrs.
Lane. “I hadn’t noticed any. It seemed
to me all a terrible series of bumps and
pot-holes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You expect altogether too much when
you come to the country,” her husband
said. “It would do you good to lead the
simple life for awhile. I’m sure Miss Hurst
could show you how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lane shuddered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are giving Miss Hurst and her
mother quite enough trouble as it is,” she
said, hastily. She gave a sudden gasp.
“My dear, have you had measles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Robin looked surprised at the
sudden query. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My boy has just had them—his quarantine
period is almost finished, but they
don’t want him back at school before the
holidays. And my husband’s eyes had been
giving him trouble, so we decided upon a
long holiday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—in Baroin?” asked Robin.
Baroin, to her, was the most uninteresting
of townships: she could imagine no reason
for spending a holiday there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fishing was the lure,” Dr. Lane said.
“I have been hearing wonderful things of
the trout in the streams here; we thought
we could put in a few weeks exploring
them, with Baroin as our headquarters.
Don’t tell me that the report is only a
rumour to catch tourists! I certainly have
failed to rise a single fish to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are trout, and big ones, if you
know where to go,” Robin told him.
“Mother and I often fish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And catch fish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course.” Robin’s eyes twinkled.
“We’re busy people; we haven’t time to fish
just for fun, like—like tourists!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a fair hit,” Dr. Lane said,
laughing. “I will certainly dog your footsteps
if I see you going out with a rod.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wouldn’t you like to go out yourself
this evening?” Robin asked. “There
are two or three good holes in a little
creek not far from our place. And the
evening rise is the best, unless you get
down really early—about dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would I like!” Dr. Lane suddenly
looked like a schoolboy. “Can you come
too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t come this evening. There is a
good deal to do. But I can easily show you
where to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let him get lost in the bush,”
spoke Mrs. Lane. “He is only a tourist,
you know!” She turned her head as they
came out of a belt of timber. “Oh, what a
charming house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is our place,” Robin said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hill Farm had indeed a look of charm
in the evening sunlight. Against a sky tinged
faintly with rosy pink the white house
nestled in the deep green of garden and
orchard, ending in the snowy gleam of the
newly-painted front fence. The slope
before it stretched to the creek, over which
they crossed on a rough-hewn bridge:
behind it cleared paddocks stretched
upwards merging into the stately timbered
hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to take you round to the back,”
Robin said, as old Roany walked slowly up
the little hill. “The front gate is too
narrow: besides, I painted the fence only
this morning, and when I paint anything it
takes two or three days to dry. So please
be careful, Dr. Lane, if you go out that
way. There’s Mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst was waiting by the back
gate, tall and fresh-looking in her simple
grey frock. She greeted them pleasantly,
exclaiming with sympathy over the poor,
bandaged foot: and presently Mrs. Lane
found herself installed in a wide room,
smelling faintly of lavender, and exquisitely
clean. The windows overlooked
the western stretch of great, tree-covered
hills. A quaint old-fashioned paper covered
the walls, bright with little trails of roses;
there were fresh roses on the dressing-table
and mantelshelf. A dainty tea-tray
stood on a table covered with a snowy
cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have everything ready for doctoring
the foot,” Mrs. Hurst said. “But I was
sure you poor things would like a cup of
tea first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lane heaved a sigh of contentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could almost weep at the sight of a
teapot,” she said. “My husband made me
drink whisky, which I hate—I tried to get
rid of the taste by eating a gum-leaf, so
that my mouth is now a miserable blend of
alcohol and eucalyptus! No, no sugar,
thank you. Dear me, how good that is!”
She looked rather like a mischievous child
as she smiled at Mrs. Hurst over her cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Lane stirred his tea reflectively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we chose the place for our
disaster very judiciously,” he said. “Certainly,
no stranded motorists ever fared
better. Are we putting you to very great
inconvenience, Mrs. Hurst? My son has
gone to telephone to the hotel to send out
our things—we could go back in the car,
when it comes, if——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst interposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that isn’t to be thought of! We
shall love to have you; Robin and I live so
quietly that to have strangers is quite
exciting and delightful, and if you can put
up with our bush ways——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Lane interrupted in his turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your bush ways, as you call them, seem
ways of smoothing out difficulties for people
in distress,” he said. “And frankly, I am
not anxious to give Mrs. Lane a jolting
drive. She has had a considerable shock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must all be feeling it, I should
imagine,” said Mrs. Hurst. “Please don’t
think of hurrying away: we shall be glad
to have you for as long as you care to stay.
I am sure that ankle needs rest, and the
Baroin hotel is not a cheerful place to rest
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, no!” said Mrs. Lane, with a
faint shudder. “My window only opens for
about three inches, and the smells—! And
the bar is always full of noisy men. But
perhaps there is a private hospital where
I could go for a few days: I don’t want to
spoil the holiday for my menfolk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I believe there is—but I don’t think
you would like it. You are not ill; a couch
on our veranda would be better for you
than any place in the township.” Mrs.
Hurst smiled, as she gathered the tea-things
together. “Let us see how you feel in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>What</span> a nice hostess!” breathed Mrs.
Lane, as the door closed behind her. “Now,
do leave me just as I am, dear, and go to
find Barry; he may lose his way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think he’ll do that,” Barry’s
father said. “But I don’t want him to walk
too far; he is not really strong yet. Sure
you will be quite comfortable until I get
back, Milly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, perfectly. Just give me a book, so
that I need not watch the scenery all the
time—scenery is <span class='it'>so</span> unchanging! And do
take care of yourselves on that horrible
hillside. If that horse should shy at a snake,
or anything, where would you be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be lost in astonishment if that
steed shied at anything whatever,” said
her husband, laughing. “If ever there were
a town mouse—!” He arranged her pillows,
gave her a book, and went off with
long strides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry was encountered sitting on a log
by the wayside. He greeted his father with
something of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly good of you to come back,” he
said, climbing into the buggy. “My legs
aren’t what they were before I had measles.
Mother all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—it is not a severe sprain. We
came off uncommonly well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect she’s pining for home,” said
Barry. “Is the farm very awful? I can’t
imagine Mother in a farm-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait until you see it,” Dr. Lane chuckled.
“We fell on our feet, Barry—you’ll
have to mind your manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry sniffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect my manners are good enough
for this part of the world,” he said, loftily.
“The hotel people were very decent: they
said a car with our things would be out
pretty soon. Gee, I could do with a cup of
tea! I found a bit of a pool and washed
my face, but the water didn’t look good
enough to drink. Have we far to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re nearly there.” They came in
sight of Hill Farm as Dr. Lane spoke.
Above them, in the little paddock near the
house, could be seen Robin, carrying in
each hand a kerosene-tin bucket, and surrounded
by an excited retinue of little pigs
and a Jersey calf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the ginger-haired girl,” said
Barry, indifferently. “Regular farm-hand,
isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder if she could teach
you a thing or two, old man,” said his
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Me!</span>” There was ineffable scorn in the
boy’s tone as he climbed out to open the
gate. “I don’t think I’ll worry any of the
wild natives for lessons, thanks!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>I could</span> ask Mrs. Hurst, of course,” said
Mrs. Lane, doubtfully. “I wonder if she
would be offended?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit likely, I should think,” her
husband answered. “She strikes one as
far too sensible a woman to be offended
by a simple business proposal. And it might
suit her very well: I gathered from something
she said last night that they have not
much money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you would not be bored—you and
Barry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barry and I want to fish,” said Dr.
Lane. “And here we’re right in the midst
of it. I might have explored round here
by myself for a week without finding that
little creek young Robin showed me last
night—and you wouldn’t have had trout
for breakfast, my dear!” His eye kindled
at the recollection of the previous evening.
“Nearly three pounds, the biggest fellow
weighed; and four others of quite a respectable
size! After failing to get a rise all
day it was almost exciting, I tell you,
Milly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, it was lovely for you,” said
Mrs. Lane, with wifely sympathy. “And
how perfectly Mrs. Hurst cooked them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t have been better. It was a
cheerful contrast to the greasy chops at the
Baroin hotel. Of course it will be dull for
you, dear, I’m afraid: but not so dull as
it would be in the township, I’m certain. If
you would let me take you home—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not to be thought of,” interrupted
his wife. “Why, you have not had a
holiday for two years!” She smiled at him.
“And there is Barry, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there’s Barry. I want him to be
quite fit before he goes back. He’s keen
on the fishing, too, and I must say I should
like him to learn something besides city
ways. It’s too bad that he’s over fifteen
and doesn’t know one end of a rod or a
gun from the other. If Mrs. Hurst would
have us here, there would be no twelve-mile
drive night and morning along that track
you dislike so much—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would decide it, if there were no
other advantages!” spoke Mrs. Lane,
briskly. “I’ll ask Mrs. Hurst, dear: after
all, she can hardly be offended. I’ll put it
very nicely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always remarked that when you
are truly tactful you are hard to refuse,”
said the doctor, gravely. “So I’ll hope for
the best. I do hope you won’t be horribly
bored, dear; it’s all very rough on you.
You have plenty of books to go on with,
haven’t you? Of course I can order anything
you like from Town. We can get the
mail every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I shall manage famously,” she said.
“Don’t think of worrying about me. I shall
write all the letters I should have written
ever so long ago, and read all the books.
And I daresay Mrs. Hurst and that nice
red Robin will come and talk to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We seem to be taking it for granted
that Mrs. Hurst will consent,” her husband
remarked. “It will be rather a blow if she
won’t have us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Hurst, handled tactfully, proved
responsive. At first she felt a quick flush
of pride and of outraged hospitality; to
make money out of these stranded people
who were her guests, seemed an impossible
thing. Then common sense came to her
aid. The Lanes, also, had their pride;
clearly, it was unthinkable that they should
remain without making any payment. And
their wish to remain was very evident:
Mrs. Hurst liked to see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, too, came in her own urgent need
of money. Despite her promise to Robin
not to worry, the thought of their tiny
bank balance was never out of her mind:
it was so flimsy a barrier between them and
disaster, should bad times come. Dr. Lane’s
offer was a generous one—more, she knew,
than he would have paid the hotel in Baroin.
She protested against it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too much for simple farm-house
accommodation,” she told him, when he
came to join in the discussion. At which he
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you saw our stuffy rooms in that
hotel—!” he said. “This is luxury; your
delightful, airy rooms, and the clean freshness
everywhere. It would be ten times the
holiday for us. Think, too, of all I shall
save in petrol, apart from the joys of the
mantelshelf road which your daughter says
I must not malign. And my wife cannot
help giving you some extra trouble, until
her ankle is better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you do not realize our limitations,”
she said. “I can’t always get good meat out
here—I have to put up with whatever the
travelling cart brings, three times a week.
And there are other difficulties. Robin and
I live so simply that we do not notice
them, but to you—from Melbourne .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
She paused unhappily, and he laughed at her
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it happens, meat does not matter
much to any of us,” he said. “Fish—such
trout as these—is a treat to us, and so are
rabbits, which we dare not touch in Melbourne.
Barry and I can shoot and fish for
the pot, which will give us an extra incentive
to do well. Try us for a week, Mrs.
Hurst, and see if we give you too much
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst had agreed, with some misgivings,
and inwardly wondering how Robin
would view the matter. But Robin was
frankly delighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we’ll make heaps of money!” she
said. “And it will be rather fine, Mother,
to have people about: I don’t much like the
boy, but his father and mother are dears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you like the boy? He seems
civil enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’s civil,” said Robin, tilting her
nose. “But he thinks too much of himself,
and he looks at my hair! He has a kind of
lofty manner, as if he thought it was very
nice for the country that he came to stay
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Barry!” said Mrs. Hurst, smiling.
“Aren’t you a little hard on him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I may be,” admitted Robin. “But
I haven’t much time for boys, especially
town ones. Danny is worth a paddockful
of them! I say, Mother, are you sure it
won’t give you too much work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t mind it at all. I must drop
other things, more or less: but the garden
is in such good order that it won’t suffer.
The sewing can wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course I’ll do all the rough
work,” said Robin, sturdily. “I can be
housemaid and slushy, and you can be
head cook and lady-of-the-house. ’Tisn’t
everyone could double those two parts, but
you could cook with one hand tied behind
you! Now, if anyone speaks to me when
I’m frying fish, it’s all up with either me
or the fish! I can run errands for Mrs.
Lane, and carry out her trays—we’ll make
her live on trays out on the veranda, shall
we, Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds uncomfortable,” smiled Mrs.
Hurst. “Still—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you know what I mean. We can
fix her up in a jolly corner with a couch
and a little table, and she really won’t be
much bother! I suppose Dr. Lane and
Barry will be out all day—that means cutting
lunches: I can do that all right.
Mother, hadn’t I better go down to Merri
Creek this afternoon and telephone to the
store in Baroin for things? We haven’t
nearly enough groceries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—and you must tell Mrs. Hawkes
I shall not be able to send her any butter
for awhile. We shall have to plan things,
Robin; it won’t do to be caught without
food, if fish and rabbits fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky I was commissariat department
at school,” said Robin, with an impish
grin. “There are four or five fowls that
can be killed.” Suddenly her face clouded.
“Mother, I could get Danny to do the killing,
couldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” said her mother, hastily.
“You didn’t think I would let you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to want to do it, and save
money,” said Robin, still looking distressed.
“But I couldn’t kill my chooks, unless I
really had to. Rabbits are different, though
I don’t enjoy dealing with them, either.
Still, they’re strangers to me, and the
chooks are intimate friends. I should feel
like the lady who suggested cutting her
baby in half for King Solomon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arrangement, begun with many misgivings
on the part of Mrs. Hurst, worked
with remarkable smoothness. Never, she
declared, were paying guests less trouble
than hers: they appeared to enjoy everything,
never grumbled, and gave as little
trouble as was possible. On the other hand,
the Lanes rejoiced in the peace and freedom
of Hill Farm. The food was simple,
but it was well cooked and daintily served:
succulent grills and savoury roasts were not,
indeed, to be procured, but Mrs. Hurst had
the skill of a magician in making the indifferent
meat of the travelling cart assume
appetizing forms, and Dr. Lane was frankly
bewildered by the variations in their meals,
and assured his hostess that she was a perpetual
surprise. The freshest of vegetables,
the yellowest of butter, the thickest of
cream—all were delightful to people accustomed
to eating food long past its first
freshness. “If I have eggs for breakfast
here,” said the doctor, “I am morally certain
that the hens have scarcely finished
cackling over them before I have eaten
them! I am growing disgracefully fat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry and his father fished and shot
early and late, comfortably certain that no
one minded erratic hours for breakfast and
tea. Dr. Lane had at first made a heroic
effort to be punctual, and had protested
when Mrs. Hurst assured him cheerfully
that it was not necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what does it matter?” she had
asked. “Robin and I have no servants to
hamper us: it does not trouble us at all if
you do come in late. And we know what
it means for you to have the morning and
evening rise for fishing; how stupid it
would be for you to miss them on account
of mere meals! As for the rabbits—if you
want them, you simply <span class='it'>must</span> be out in the
evening. I can’t give you dinner at night,
but you can have a meal whenever you
choose to come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the trouble to you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there isn’t any trouble. I make
my preparations beforehand, and all the
rest can be done while you are taking off
your boots or washing your hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is keeping you on duty all the
time. If you had heard the frigid warnings
of the hotel in Baroin as to what we might
expect if we got home after six—!” At
which Mrs. Hurst’s head went up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am not the Baroin hotel, Dr.
Lane. You must recognize certain differences
between Hill Farm and that haughty
establishment.” Dr. Lane had laughed at
the twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank my lucky stars for them every
day,” he had responded. “Well, if you are
really sure that it does not make things too
hard for you, it is certainly delightful to
feel that one can carry on with a free conscience.
I’m the slave of a time-table in
Melbourne: it is sheer rest to know that at
Hill Farm time does not seem to exist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only so far as you wish it to exist,”
Mrs. Hurst had answered. “We want you
to enjoy yourselves, Robin and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lane had shaken down to captivity
with surprising philosophy. Her husband
had devoted his first morning to the manufacture
of a makeshift crutch, by means
of which she could move about a little,
giving her a feeling of independence that
added greatly to her cheerfulness. She
laughed delightedly at her own clumsy efforts
at movement, even while the pain
made her wince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was always taught by my mother that
grace was essential to a woman!” she said.
“Dear me, if she could see me now! Robin,
you bad child, don’t laugh at the afflicted—you
should be full of sympathy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am; but you would make anyone
laugh,” Robin defended herself. She was
standing by, ready to help the guest’s progress
towards the veranda. “Do lean on
me a bit, Mrs. Lane—I know it’s hurting
you horribly, and I don’t believe Dr. Lane
would approve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly he wouldn’t—but then, men
are so fussy, aren’t they?” responded the
afflicted one. “And I won’t be more helpless
than I have to be. Just be handy in
case I stumble. I shall be much more accomplished
to-morrow; this third leg of mine
isn’t really broken-in yet.” She reached the
couch in safety, and collapsed upon it with
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!—I did it! Just lift the old ankle
up for me, my dear, and put that horrid
implement where I can’t see it—not out of
my reach, though. I may feel the need of
exercise later on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you ought to feel any such
thing,” said Robin, much concerned, although
it was impossible not to laugh at
the cheerful sufferer. “See, there’s a little
bell on your table, Mrs. Lane: do ring if
you want anything. I shall be just round
the corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thin my turnips; they’re crowding each
other out of the ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me!” said Mrs. Lane, looking at
her respectfully. “You and your mother
are people of many activities. I wish you
would sit down and be restful for a few
minutes: I know I saw you pass my window
at five o’clock this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely,” Robin said, smiling. “I
hope I didn’t disturb you, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No: I was awake. Do sit down: I know
I’ll need something in about two minutes—I
don’t remember yet what it is, but it
will come to me! So it would be a pity if
you went. That’s right; now I can feel
more restful myself. Tell me, why do you
and your mother live in this big place alone?
I know I’m very inquisitive, but I was born
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we must live somewhere,” Robin
laughed. “And Uncle Donald left the place
to Mother. He was an old widower, and he
hadn’t anyone else to leave it to—that’s
why we got it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did he live here alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but for a housekeeper. He bought
the place very cheaply: of course, he didn’t
use it all, but it was so cheap he didn’t
mind that. Uncle Donald never could resist
a bargain. He used to buy things at
sales, just because they were cheap; the
house is full of queer old things he picked
up.” Robin grinned. “I was the worst
bargain he ever made!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he get you cheaply?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He got me for nothing, but he thought
I was dear at any price. It was mostly my
hair, I think: it had a most irritating effect
upon him. Goodness knows, it’s burden
enough to carry a flame-coloured head
through life, without one’s uncles objecting
to it. I thought it should make me an object
of sympathy, but Uncle Donald seemed
to fancy that the sympathy should be
given to him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lane chuckled delightedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you didn’t get on very well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—not exactly,” said Robin, demurely.
“We disapproved of each other.
I could have put up with that, but I couldn’t
stand the way he used to speak to Mother.
He really wasn’t a nice old man, Mrs. Lane.
You would have said so yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t sound nice,” said Mrs. Lane.
“But I like his house. Don’t you and your
mother find it very lonely, though? I can
imagine being happy here for a few weeks—but
to live here! I should want more
civilization and fewer cows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’re never lonely. There is too
much to do, and we’re so glad to be together.
You see, I was away at school for
two years, and we both hated that.” She
jumped up, suddenly, as her mother appeared,
bearing a tray. “Mother, you ought
to have called me to carry that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were in the garden—but
I’m very glad to find you sitting down,”
said Mrs. Hurst, smiling at her. “Just a
cup of eleven o’clock tea, Mrs. Lane. I
hope Robin has been looking after you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellently—and I have been shamelessly
keeping her from her work. But she
begins so early!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed she does—too early. I was just
going to call you in for your tea, Robin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do have it out here with me,” begged
Mrs. Lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst twinkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure that that would be correct
behaviour,” she said. “Is it done?—the
farm-workers intruding on the guest—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be horrid!” pleaded the guest. “I
am an invalid, and I need special treatment.
Robin, dear, do bring your Mother’s
tea and your own, and let us have a party.
Cheerful companionship is what my ankle
needs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—Madam’s luncheon?” laughed Mrs.
Hurst, sitting down, obediently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—lunch!” said the afflicted guest,
scornfully. “Madam can eat a boiled egg.
She consumes nourishment in your house
at such frequent intervals that when her
ankle is better she’ll only be able to waddle!
You bring out to me trays loaded
with food, and I strongly suspect you both
of perching on the kitchen-table and dining
on bread-and-butter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might,” she admitted, “if it were not
that I have Robin—just as Robin certainly
would, but for the fact that she has me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not me!” said Robin, firmly. “I want
full rations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She certainly needs them, for she works
very hard,” said her mother. “So I make
a point of having meals properly served:
it is good for us both, for it’s easy for
women living alone to get into slack ways.
We don’t perch on the kitchen-table; we
eat very respectably, on the veranda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how nice! May I come there, too,
when my silly ankle is better? I won’t ask
you when Edward and Barry happen to be
at home, for I know you would hate to
have the whole party there—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would!” Mrs. Hurst smiled, frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when it is just we three? At home
I have lunch alone every day—it suits
Edward better to lunch at his club, and
Barry is at school. I hate the sight of the
lonely table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should like to have you very much,
if you can bear lunching with people in
working clothes. No human power can
get Robin out of breeches until the evening,
and not always then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think not,” said Robin, warmly.
“Fancy getting into a frock when one has
to feed pigs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lane shuddered delicately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know how you do it—and manage
to remain so nice!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s all fun,” Robin answered. “I
haven’t yet managed to see the fun of
skinning rabbits, but it has to be done: no
doubt the humour of it will strike me in
time. Mrs. Lane, when you are better,
aren’t you going out with your menfolk?
You’d have an awfully good time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the guest shuddered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” she said, confidentially, “I
was never made for the country. I can be
quite happy while my men-folk are enjoying
themselves, so long as they don’t ask
me to join them: I simply loathe a gun, and
as for dangling a worm on a fishing-rod,
nothing bores me more, unless it is casting
a fly, which I find actively irritating—cast
as I will, the abominable insect never goes
in the right place! I think your veranda
is delightful, as long as no one asks me to
look at the scenery or to gaze at live cows
or chickens—or pigs! All, to my mind,
are better in their inanimate forms. You
won’t ask me to admire ducklings, will you,
Robin, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never—unless cooked!” said Robin,
laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then I can admire them whole-heartedly.
What an understanding child
you are! No—I really don’t want my ankle
to recover too quickly: then I can lie here
with an easy mind, read and write, and
realize that civilization is really not far off
whenever I see a motor crawling painfully
along that awful track below. I can also
be devoutly thankful that I am not in it!
Life is full of compensations to the injured,
I find—especially in a place like Hill Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very cheering that you can take it
that way,” said Mrs. Hurst, smiling at the
merry, mischievous face—there were times
when it seemed ridiculous to think that Mrs.
Lane was really the mother of a boy of
fifteen. “I hope your husband and Barry
are as happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, they’re in ecstasies! Edward
says he has never been so delighted with
a place—as for Barry, he shot two rabbits
yesterday and caught three trout and
an eel, and apparently life has nothing
more to offer him. We are only haunted
by a fear that you will find we give you
too much trouble, and send us back to that
appalling hotel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst laughed outright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’re no trouble at all! Dr. Lane
brings in all his game ready prepared for
the table—I wonder does he dream how
Robin and I bless him for it!—and as for
you, we give you a bell which you never
dream of ringing. I caught your husband
chopping wood yesterday, much to my horror.
He wasn’t in the least impressed by
my protests—in fact, he sent me away, and
he and Barry brought the wood in, and
filled the box!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t dream of interfering with his
pastimes!” said his wife. “He chops wood
at home when he has had an unusually
aggravating patient—it seems to work off
his pent-up feelings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope he has not any feelings of that
kind here,” spoke Mrs. Hurst, with some
anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no—it’s just the joy of living, in
this case: it has to find expression somewhere.
Barry works his off by singing in
his bath, and as his voice has not quite
finished cracking, the effect is blithe, but
peculiar. We’re just a very fortunate
family, Mrs. Hurst, and we hope you’ll keep
us a month!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin rose with an air of determination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case,” she said, briskly, “I’ve
simply <span class='it'>got</span> to go and thin those turnips!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MAKING FRIENDS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>What</span> are those things?” asked Barry,
lounging at the shed doorway, hands in
pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rabbit-skins,” answered Robin, shortly.
She was kneeling by an open box, packing
what looked like piles of envelopes of
parchment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t look much like rabbits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose our skins would look
much like us if they were pulled off inside
out,” Robin responded, grimly practical.
“Ten—eleven—twelve!” She tied a string
round the bundle she held, made a note on
a piece of paper, and proceeded to count
a fresh dozen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’d you get them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shot them.” Robin looked ruefully at
a much-punctured skin which had apparently
been shot at too close quarters, hesitated
a moment, and then, with reluctance,
decided to reject it. Barry sniggered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gave him the whole cartridge, didn’t
you? Did he sit still while you walked up
and potted him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—ours always do. Haven’t you
noticed? I thought that was how you managed
to shoot the two you got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry flushed. He was grimly aware of
the number of cartridges he had expended.
Apparently this provoking farm-girl knew
something about it, too. He decided to
pursue the matter no further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do with the skins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send them to Melbourne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—are they worth anything? We
never keep ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t suppose you do,” said Robin,
carelessly. Her tone classed Barry finally
among the people who toil not, neither do
they spin: and somehow, Barry fully
understood that it was not a compliment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never thought of it,” he responded,
equally carelessly. “Who gets yours ready
for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myself. Seven—eight—nine,” counted
Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t skin rabbits?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do. Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t think it was a girl’s job, that’s
all.” Barry whittled a stick with an unconscious
air. “Of course, I suppose
country girls are different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean different?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, town girls simply couldn’t do
jobs like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because they wouldn’t know how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Partly. They wouldn’t like it, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, country girls don’t exactly revel
in it,” responded Robin. “But we don’t
make a silly fuss about doing necessary
things. We’ve got more important things
to think of than town girls have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry sniggered again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good one,” he said. “I’d like
some of the girls I know to hear you. They’d
be amused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’d be welcome to their amusement,
poor things!” said Robin, in a tone
of lofty pity. “By the way, do you mind
moving out of the light? Thanks—eleven—twelve.”
She tied up a new dozen, and
Barry felt the warm indignation of a very
small boy who has been told to run away
and play while older people work. He took
up a position on the other side of the wide
doorway, whittling more vigorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever been in Town?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—now and then. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking it would be rather a surprise
to you, in some ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” said Robin, with surprising
meekness. “Awfully exciting, crossing the
streets, don’t you think? I get terribly
scared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry assumed the patronizing air of a
complete man of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you would,” he said. “All
the country people do. Awfully funny to
see them at Show time—they always get
on the wrong trams, and try to talk to the
drivers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly as funny as the Town people
out at the Show,” said Robin. “Ever seen
them trying to understand a disc-plough?
And they talk about a horse’s back-foot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why wouldn’t they?” queried Barry,
unwisely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—if you don’t know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
Robin smiled with extreme sweetness, and
packed another dozen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry pondered uneasily for a moment,
and decided to seek information on the
matter from a more sympathetic source.
He sought to change the subject, but no
inspiration presented itself except rabbit-skins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How d’you get those things into that
flat shape?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stretch them on bent wires. There are
some hanging up,” said Robin, nodding
towards a corner of the shed, where skins
hung in a dismal row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must need a lot of wires. Do you buy
them ready-made?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—catch us wasting money that way!
Danny made me those.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—that big lout from over at the next
farm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gunpowder stored beneath Robin’s
red thatch exploded suddenly. Barry, had
he not been somewhat overwhelmed by the
concussion, might have congratulated himself
on having drawn blood at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you talk like that!” she said,
sharply. “I’ve got to be polite to you,
’cause your mother and father are so nice,
but if you think you can sneer at our
friends you’re jolly well mistaken, Mr.
Barry Lane! Danny a lout, indeed!
Danny’s got more sense in his little finger
than you, or any other town boy, have in
your whole body! He could show you the
way about everything that really matters,
only he wouldn’t be seen wasting his time
over you!” She whirled past him, scarlet
with anger, and left him to digest her
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew-w!” whistled Barry. “I put my
foot well in that time, didn’t I?” His dark
skin had flushed hotly. “Scissors, can’t
she flare up! And all over that big farm-chap.
He looks a lout, anyhow. But I
suppose, living in the country, she doesn’t
notice it.” He pondered the matter rather
uneasily, realizing, somewhat to his own
disgust, that he had transgressed his own
code. When you were staying with people
you did not abuse their friends. Apparently,
that was what he had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strolled round to the front of the
house, disconsolately. Dinner was over:
before him stretched a long and lonely
afternoon. The mail, arriving in the middle
of the day, had brought with it a request
to Dr. Lane for a paper on some
abstruse medical subject for a learned
society: the doctor, groaning heavily, had
shut himself up in his room, to write until
evening. Barry was left to his own resources,
and at the moment they seemed
to him insufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lane was on her couch. The injury
to her ankle was a week old, but she
declared that the joint still needed rest,
although, to the unprejudiced eye, it looked
much like the other. She greeted her son
with a quick little smile. He sat down on
the edge of the veranda near her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bored, Barry-boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. I’ll go fishing, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what is wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry grinned at her, recognizing the
detective eye. They told each other most
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been cheap,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And nasty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “Yes, a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Robin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want to tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t think so, Mother. Not
worth it. But I came to the conclusion I
was cheap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When that happens,” said little Mrs.
Lane, looking like a wise mother-bird, “the
only thing to do is to get back to the level
where one belongs. Otherwise one remains
marked-down, like the damaged goods at
a sale. You’ll find a way. I would go out,
if I were you, and show Father you can
catch trout without him.” She smiled at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right-oh!” he said, rising. “I’ll get my
kit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came out again presently, in a scout
shirt and knickers, with stout wading
boots, looking younger than in his customary
long trousers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had never thought to see your knees
again,” said his mother. “I thought they
had disappeared into trousers for ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father knew what he was about when
he made me bring shorts,” said Barry.
“They dry in no time after wading—and
you can’t fish these creeks without wading
half your time. Great pair of knees, aren’t
they, Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re like a cross-word puzzle, with
scratches. How do you manage to knock
them about so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—blackberries, and wild raspberries,
and prickly-Moses, and other affectionate
plants,” he said. “They all seem to cling to
me. I’m as clumsy as a bear in the bush—never
manage to dodge anything. Father
says one doesn’t develop the sense of
moving in the bush all at once, so I can
only hope it will come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you like it, Barry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s dark face lit up suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I love it,” he said. “It bored me
stiff that first day, but now it grows on me
more each time I’m out in it. Father’s an
awfully good mate, you know: he shows
me ever so many things I’d never see for
myself. He’s jolly patient too—I make a
fool of myself in heaps of ways, but he
never seems to mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He tells me you are developing a good
deal of common sense with your gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry beamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he? I’m jolly glad. I know I did
a lot of idiotic things at first. I nearly hit
him the second night—did he tell you,
Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lane repressed a shudder. But
her voice was quite calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he didn’t tell me, son. I don’t suppose
he would tell me that sort of thing.
Was it—very near?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I hit a tree about ten yards
from him. But that wasn’t the point—it
might just as well have been Father, because
I didn’t know that the blessed thing
was going off. I thought it wasn’t cocked.”
He looked at her ruefully, and found her
smile very comforting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you didn’t hit him, it was probably
a very good thing it happened,” she said.
“It would teach you a good deal, Barry-boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what it did,” he said. “I
thought I knew all about it before, and it
just showed me what an utter fool I was.
Mother, I don’t think I’d ever be that
particular kind of idiot again. I just shook
for about ten minutes. And he was such a
brick about it. I was scared he’d say I
mustn’t use a gun again, but instead he
said that was just the time to go on using
it—so that I wouldn’t be likely to forget.
I guess I won’t, either!”—and Barry set
his jaw in a hard line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your grandfather believed in that,”
said Mrs. Lane. “When I was quite small—yes,
I know I am small now, but I was
still smaller then!—I used to ride a great
grey mare on which I felt rather like a pea
sitting on an elephant. I fell off her one
day, and was sure I was killed—I believed
grandfather thought so, too, until he had
picked me up and discovered nothing
worse than bruises. Then he caught the
grey mare and put me on her at once,
while I howled vigorous protests, assuring
him that I would fall off again at once.
But he only laughed, and said, ‘Not you,
Milly!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did you?” Barry asked, much interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not. I stuck on, and we
galloped home in triumph. And I rode
that mare for years, and never had another
toss: more than that, I was never afraid
again. And you never will be in doubt
again as to whether your gun is cocked or
not, Barry—you’ll know it is not cocked
unless you want to fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I won’t,” he said. “But I
won’t be cock-sure, Mother! Gracious,
wasn’t that brilliant, for me, and I never
meant to say it, either! I think I’d better
go fishing, or I may make more puns.” He
took off his cap as she blew him a kiss,
and went striding down the hill, his rod
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luck was kind to him at first: he hooked
a trout in a long stretch of rippling water,
and managed to land it after five minutes’
highly unscientific play, trembling all the
while for fear of making a fatal mistake;
quite certain that no rod could stand the
strain of being bent like a whip, with a
leaping, fighting fish at its delicate end.
When he finally managed to net it, after
two unsuccessful attempts, and had killed
it with a swift, merciful blow, as his father
had taught him, he laid the still-twitching
body on the grass and fairly gloated. The
sunlight rippled on the golden-brown sides,
spotted with scarlet. It was a fine fish,
nearly two pounds. Barry felt that he had
made a definite step towards manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky for me you were hooked so
firmly, old chap,” he said. “I’d have lost
you for a certainty if you’d been lightly
hooked. Golly, I am glad I got you!” He
cleaned the trout and stowed it in his bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that the goddess of Luck removed
her face from him, and he fished pool after
pool in vain: growing somewhat impatient
as the afternoon wore on, and no new capture
had gone to join his first prey. Still,
it was jolly in the quiet stillness of the
bush, where only bird-calls broke the stillness:
even if the fish were shy there was
fresh excitement in trying each promising
bit of water, and always failure was solaced
by the comforting weight of the bag—he
could go home and show them that a town
boy could hook and kill a decent trout unaided.
The red-haired girl evidently didn’t
think much of townsfolk. Well, he would
show her! And then he grew a little less
cheerful, for when the red-haired girl was
concerned Barry was still feeling cheap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was thinking of her when suddenly
he came upon her, as he rounded a scrub-covered
bend. Ahead was a wide pool
with a little rushy island in its midst: he
had fished it with his father, and had
looked forward to getting to it again, for
it was a good pool. But Robin had got
there first: a fine trout on the bank beside
her, almost as big a fish as his own, showed
that she had not wasted her time. As he
came, she flicked her spinner across the
water again—and uttered an exclamation
of annoyance as it caught in a little bush
in the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin tried to twitch it free, but it was
evidently held strongly, and she dared not
risk breaking her rod. She laid it down
on the bank and pulled and jerked the line—all
to no purpose. The bush swayed, but
the hooks of the spinner clung closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are a pig!” said Robin,
heartily. She glanced round and saw
Barry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s hard luck,” he said. “What will
you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wade, I suppose,” she answered,
shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easier to break the line, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin looked her scorn of this suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a new spinner, and the best cast
I’ve got,” she said. “I can’t afford to waste
tackle.” She turned from him and looked
doubtfully at the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it deep?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure; it might be better to swim
than to wade. It might be snaggy—you
never can tell, in these pools, what snags
may have floated down and sunk. Oh, I’ll
chance wading: if it gets too deep I’ll have
to go home and get bathing-togs and
swim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll swim over for you,” he offered
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, thanks,” was Robin’s stiff
reply. Evidently she had not forgotten
their encounter after lunch: she would not
accept any favour from him. She waded
out into the pool, while Barry watched her
uneasily. The water, swift and brown,
seemed to him altogether too deep for
wading—especially for a girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you’d let me swim,” he called.
“Here, I’ll get my boots off: it doesn’t
matter if I get wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down on the bank and unlaced
his boots hurriedly, heedless of the fact
that Robin had not answered. The socks
followed the boots, and he stood barefooted
on the bank, again begging her to
come back. But Robin’s “red-haired
streak,” as her schoolfellows had called it,
was uppermost, although she began to
realize that the water was too deep for wading.
Had she been alone, she would have
turned back to the bank: but not before the
supercilious youngster who had called
good old Danny a lout. “I’ll give it a yard
more,” she muttered to herself. “It may
not get any deeper than it is now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stone turned under her foot. She
lurched forward uncertainly in the knee-deep
water, saving herself from falling
only by taking a long step. Her foot went
down—down: there was no bottom anywhere,
and no drawing back. She gave a
little choked cry as the water closed over
her red head. It was a cry that expressed
exasperation more than fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kicked downwards as she sank, to
send herself up to the surface, and something
closed like a vice upon her foot.
Something that held and clung, tantalizing
her with a swing that felt as though it were
yielding, but never releasing its grip. She
knew what it was, as she struggled in sick
fear: knew how the old, water-logged gum
boughs lie along the bottom, spikes driven
into the mud holding the crooked, forked
limbs that swing and sway with the current,
never released until they rot away
and mingle with the stream. She knew
how little time she had to fight. Already
her lungs seemed bursting with the effort
of holding her breath: already her limbs
were heavy and helpless. And the grip
was no less tight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the bank, Barry had uttered an exclamation
of dismay as Robin disappeared.
He was not alarmed, for she had spoken
easily of swimming: still, he knew that no
girl likes an involuntary ducking. He
waited for the red head to bob up again,
prepared to shout sympathetically to her.
Fifteen seconds went by: thirty: and suddenly
the boy found his heart beginning to
pump like an engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s been under nearly a minute!” he
muttered. “Something’s wrong.” He
blessed the impulse that had made him
kick off his boots, as he dived into the
pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water was muddy with Robin’s
struggling, but he came upon her quickly.
Sinking down, his hands encountered the
imprisoned foot, and he grasped the bough.
One of his feet, as he kicked, found a moment’s
purchase upon another snag; it
held as he put all his force into a desperate
tug, slipping off just as the bough broke
short at the fork. An inch less, and it
would still have gripped Robin’s boot. As
it was, Barry saw her float slowly upwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was after her like a flash and drew
her into the shallow water: she had not
lost consciousness, but was capable of only
the feeblest paddling. They reached the
bank, and she lay down on the grass, still
gasping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swallow any water?” he asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. Under water,
Barry Lane was entirely capable: on land
he became a rather scared boy, without the
faintest idea of what to do for a half-drowned
lady in distress. So he rubbed
her hands very hard, and uttered disjointed
words of encouragement, such as “Buck
up, old chap!”—which perhaps was as
effective as anything he could have done.
At any rate, Robin presently sneezed violently,
gave a feeble grin, and sat up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was nearly a goner that time!” she
remarked, inelegantly. Her voice shook,
and Barry frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better lie down again,” he counselled.
“I vote you keep quiet and I’ll run up and
fetch Father—and some brandy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I’m all right. At least I will be in
a minute or two,” she shuddered. “Ugh,
it was awful down there—I thought I’d
never get free. Never would, either, if
you hadn’t come. However did you do
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry grinned feebly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it was easy—I was born in Queensland,
and I could swim under water almost
before I could walk. We used to have competitions
to see who could stay under
longest and pick up most things. Only
this water was so jolly muddy that it was
hard to make out anything.” He sat back
on his heels and looked at her. “Sure
you’re all right? Golly, you gave me a
fright!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right, but I’m awfully cold. I
think I’d better move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s help you up,” Barry said. He
hauled her ungently to her feet, and she
promptly staggered and caught at his
shoulder. In a moment her head steadied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m better,” she said. “I’ll just
walk home slowly.” She turned, but stopped
as he moved towards the creek. “What
are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just get your spinner,” he said, carelessly.
“You go on—I’ll catch you up with
the rods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You aren’t going back into that beastly
creek!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to waste your tackle,”
he said, laughing. “Don’t worry—I’ll
look out for snags.” He swam across
carefully, keeping his body almost on the
surface, and freed the spinner from the
clutches of the bush. In a moment he was
back on the bank beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—do go on!” he protested. “I’ve
got to get my boots on, and you’ll certainly
get pneumonia or something if you stand
there with your teeth chattering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him without speaking for
an instant. Then she turned and walked
unsteadily away, while Barry forced his
wet feet into his boots and gathered up the
rods and fish. He caught her up in the
next paddock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feel all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—right enough. Just a bit
shaky, but nothing to matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want a good rub-down and a hot
drink,” counselled Barry. “I hope your
mother won’t be scared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t, ’cause she’ll see I’m alive,”
said Robin, with something of her usual
twinkle. It was a washy twinkle, but
Barry was relieved to see that it was there.
“But we’re a lovely pair, to be coming
home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better wet than dead!” grinned her
dripping companion. “And anyhow, we’ve
brought home our breakfast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and you saved my tackle. That
was awfully decent of you. You saved my
life, too, but you might have felt you had
to do that—but there was no need for you
to go back after that spinner. I—I’m just
awfully obliged to you.” The speech was
an effort, and she hurried on, squelching
in her wet boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry might reasonably have felt bewildered
at this peculiar distribution of
gratitude, but he saw nothing to criticize.
He was oppressed by the necessity of making
a speech himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was no end of a swine this morning,”
he said, flushing. “What I said about
Danny, I mean. It was a low-down thing
to say—I’m sorry, Robin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flashed a smile at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” she said, with embarrassment.
“I was rather a pig, too. I
won’t be again, if you won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather not!” said Barry. They
squelched companionably towards the
house.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MERRI CREEK FALLS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>I thought</span>, a week ago,” said Dr. Lane,
“that my son and your daughter intended
to remain for ever in a state of armed
neutrality. They bristled at sight of each
other, like two terriers, and politeness was
all that restrained them from combat.
There were even indications that the politeness
was wearing thin. And look at them
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waved a hand towards the little flat
below the house, where Robin and Barry,
mounted on ponies borrowed from Mr.
Merritt, had erected a brush hurdle and
were taking turns in jumping. The ponies
were awkward, and the riders not highly
skilled; when they succeeded in making the
steeds face the hurdle they did not always
get them over; when they got them over
they rarely remained in the saddle. These
minor defects did not chill the ardour of
the riders. Shouts of laughter echoed up
the hill, mingled with mutual comments
that lacked nothing of frankness. Beyond
doubt, the partnership was firmly established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This seems to be the result of
impromptu mixed bathing,” said Mrs.
Hurst, laughing, as her eyes dwelt on
Robin. “I still shiver at the thought of my
girl’s danger—but I am not altogether
sorry it happened. They are very happy
together. And it is so good for Robin to
have a friend. She did not realize how
lonely she was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She didn’t suggest loneliness. I think
the companionship between you was very
delightful, and she will find it so again
when Barry has gone. But youth calls to
youth. As for Barry—it has always been
our regret that he has no sister. To be
friends with a girl like your Robin is very
good for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barry doesn’t in the least regard Robin
as a girl,” said Mrs. Lane, from the couch
where she was generally to be found, in
spite of the fact both silk-clad ankles
were equally slender. “He told me this
morning that the best thing about her was
that she was just like a boy. ‘No silly girl-tricks!’
said Barry. ‘I can’t stand girls!’
And he was quite sure he meant it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet he has many little chivalrous
ways with her that he certainly would not
show for another boy,” Mrs. Hurst
remarked. “I do not think he even knows
he has them. But they are there, all the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to hear that you have noticed
that,” said Dr. Lane. “I thought I had, too:
but I was afraid it might be only desire to
think so on my part!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no; I have seen a dozen little
proofs. Why, I found him cleaning her
boots to-day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is indeed a proof, for it is hard
enough to make him clean his own when
he is at home,” said Mrs. Lane, laughing.
“When Barry cleans a boot he declines to
perceive that it has any back. Oh, look!—his
pony jumped the hurdle without knocking
it down, and he didn’t fall off! My
Barry will be a jockey before he leaves here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only hope we shall return him to you
undamaged,” said Mrs. Hurst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it had been settled that Barry should
stay another month at Hill Farm. Business
was calling Dr. Lane to Queensland, and
his wife insisted that he should not go
alone: but Barry hated the hot weather of
the North, and was so happy in the bush
that his parents had begged Mrs. Hurst to
keep him. Barry himself welcomed the
suggestion with delight; anything was better
than to grill for weeks in Brisbane in
midsummer; and Hill Farm, where he had
settled down as though it had always been
his home, was a very lucky alternative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The partnership between him and Robin
had deepened into a firm friendship.
Barry’s feeling of natural superiority as a
boy had quickly vanished before the girl’s
leadership in all bushcraft. He was a
clumsy new chum where she trod with the
sure, quick step of one who has entered into
her kingdom. The dense scrub that puzzled
him was to her an open book, for she had
that instinctive knowledge of direction and
of unconscious observation that marks the
bushman born. It irritated Barry, now
and then, that she should know so much.
“For, after all, you haven’t been here so
awfully long yourself,” he would say.
Robin could not explain it. “I feel as if
I’d been born knowing the bush,” she would
answer, half apologetically. “But you’re
getting on splendidly, Barry, so don’t
worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the month for which the Lanes
had asked had gone by, and Dr. Lane was,
as he said, “screwing-out” a few more days
before he and his wife must go North. It
had been a very happy month; everything
had gone smoothly, the Lanes had been the
most cheerful and considerate of paying-guests,
and Mrs. Hurst marvelled at the
ease with which she had managed her big
household. There was satisfaction in that,
as there was in the thought of the comfortable
little balance mounting up in the
bank: solid satisfaction, too, in the knowledge
that she and Robin had made good
friends. The Lanes declared that nothing
should prevent their visit being a yearly
one, so long as Hill Farm would have them:
they had exacted a half-promise that Robin
and her mother should visit them in Melbourne.
The vision of the future, when
Robin must go to the city to learn typing,
lost half its terrors for the anxious mother
now that she knew that her child would not
be friendless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the flat below, the riders decided that
their ponies had had enough tuition in
jumping—perhaps induced to this conclusion
by their own bruises. They came cantering
up, passed the house with a gay
shout, and presently appeared on the
veranda, flushed and hot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you done with the ponies?”
asked Mrs. Hurst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taken them back to their own paddock:
Mr. Merritt wants them to-morrow. Oh,
Mother, we’ve had fun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seemed to be enjoying life,” Dr.
Lane said. “I hope the ponies enjoyed it
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they were quite happy. They knew
ever so much more about it than we did—but
we managed to get the same point of
view after a while. Jumping’s great sport,”
Barry ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you stick on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—or even when you don’t. The
grass is so thick down there it’s like falling
on a carpet, and if we fell off the ponies
always stopped very kindly and began to
feed. It must be much more disheartening
to fall off and see your horse disappearing
into the distance: I like them trained to
pause, like these.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never had the luck to ride a pauser,”
remarked Dr. Lane. “When I quitted the
saddle they invariably quitted me, at the
rate of knots, and I had to walk miles
before I found them. Hence, I prefer
motors, which do not run away——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even down a hillside?” asked Robin,
wickedly. “I knew a Buick—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The very thing to prove what I was saying,”
returned Dr. Lane. “Even when the
wicked tracks of Gippsland let a good car
over the edge, what does the good car do?
Somersault to the bottom? Certainly not.
It hastily finds a tree, and leans up against
it, waiting for its master!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uttering gentle bleats, to attract his
attention,” finished Robin, softly. “That’s
what I noticed about the car I mentioned.
And everyone seemed so pleased with it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It played us a very good trick, at all
events,” remarked the doctor, shaking his
fist at her. “Think what a holiday we have
had because it chose that spot to fall over
the edge, and what a hideous time we should
have had if it had gone peacefully on its
way to Baroin. I refuse to hear one word
against my car. But there’s something else
I want to consult you about, Robin. Do
you know the way to the Merri Creek
Falls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin knitted her brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never been quite to the Falls,” she
said. “I did go a good deal of the way
with a camping-party more than two years
ago. We gave it up: I was young then, and
they were all soft, and the going was certainly
very bad. I believe there is a better
track now. Why, Dr. Lane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d like to go there,” he said. “A
man I met fishing yesterday told me they
were well worth seeing. It’s a bit of a
rough trip, he said, but we could do it in
the day if we made an early start. I
thought you and Barry and I could tackle
it, if your mother were willing. I have
got permission from my headquarters”—he
nodded meekly towards his wife. “This
fellow told me there was good fishing in
the creek below the falls. He had been
camping there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am quite willing, but I should strongly
advise against fishing,” Mrs. Hurst said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The track is exceedingly rough; I don’t
think you realize what a nuisance rods
would be to you on a long walk in such
country: and fish, if you got them, would
be an added burden on the way back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds common-sense,” said the
doctor, regretfully. “Well, after all, I
have had better fishing here than I ever
hoped to have, so I may as well put it out
of my head. But I would like to see those
falls. Feel inclined, Barry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Aunt!” said Barry, eagerly. “It
would be a ripping day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about you, Robin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m always ready for an excursion,”
she said. “But I warn you, it will be
rougher walking than anything you have
done about here. We shall have to wade
the creek ever so many times; I remember
we walked in the creek itself for a good
way, but perhaps the track will save us that
now. When would you like to go, Dr.
Lane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, I thought; it’s beautiful
weather, and I have so few days left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think we could get breakfast at
five o’clock, Mother?” Robin asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five!” exclaimed her four hearers in
various notes of horror. But Robin only
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve tried to get to those Falls, and you
haven’t,” she said. “I’m all for an early
start, to get as far as we can before the day
grows hot. We can always rest on the
way—and we’ll want to!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m beginning to think this is a more
serious expedition than I had imagined,”
laughed the doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know that it’s serious,”
Robin answered. “But it <span class='it'>is</span> rough, and I
warn you that I don’t know any short cuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you get lost?” demanded Mrs.
Lane. “If so, I shall hang bells on all three
of you before you start!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t be up,” said Barry,
solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should rise to the occasion,” was his
mother’s lofty reply. “But tell me, Robin:
I am going to enter a protest if there is any
fear of your being bushed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we can’t get bushed if we stick to
the creek,” Robin said. “There are short
cuts, I know, that make the distance much
less, but of course, it wouldn’t be safe to
tackle them. So we must be prepared for a
long day. I could get breakfast ready to-night,
Mother, and pack the lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: I will help you. You must all eat
enormous quantities of eggs and bacon
before you start—then I shall feel more
easy about you,” Mrs. Hurst said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If anyone, a month ago, had told me I
could devour eggs and bacon at five o’clock
in the morning, I should have thought him
mad,” said Dr. Lane. “But I feel now that
I could tackle anything that was offered me,
at any hour. That’s the result of Hill Farm,
Mrs. Hurst!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even though it was almost midsummer,
it was chilly enough in the deep gullies when
they set out the next morning. The mists
had not yet risen: ahead of them the bush
was dim and mysterious, and every bough
dripped with moisture. For the first few
miles they were able to keep above the creek,
following sheep-tracks through the hill
settlers’ country: they walked steadily,
anxious to get as far as possible before the
real fatigue of the journey began. Then
they came to the last of the clearing. Before
them ranged the tall rounded masses of the
hills, covered with dense scrub and giant
trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’ll have to stick to the creek,
unless we can find a track,” Robin said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went down the steep hillside, and
were lucky in coming upon a narrow path
that followed the windings of the creek. It
was not easy travelling: the track was so
narrow, the greedy march of the bush so
swift, that the undergrowth brushed their
faces, and often they were forced to hold it
apart while they forced their way through.
Sometimes it curved sharply round the butts
of huge trees, leaving only the barest footing,
where one went, clinging to any stray
shoot of musk or hazel as a support: sometimes
it dipped into waterworn gullies
where brambles disputed every yard of the
way. But still, it was a track; and Robin,
at least, was duly grateful for it. Below
them the creek sang and rippled on its way:
occasionally they caught glimpses of the
brown water, gurgling over its boulder-strewn
bed. But for the most part the scrub
undergrowth hemmed them in, and they
went in single file, seeing nothing but the
dense green wall on either side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was past nine o’clock when the track
suddenly ended in an enormous fallen tree,
the butt of which, six feet high, made a grey
wall before them. Its roots, now intertwined
with scrub, stretched down to the
creek. They followed along its great
length, and the pale shadow of a track
seemed to them to stretch away northward
into the bush. But Robin, looking at it,
shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be our track,” she said. “And
then, again, it mightn’t. I don’t like trying
experiments in this sort of country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No experiments for me, thank you,” Dr.
Lane said, briskly. “The creek is definite:
we’ll stick to it.” He looked at his companions.
“How are you two feeling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First-rate,” said Robin and Barry in
chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good. Still, I think we’ll have
twenty minutes’ spell, not because we are
tired, but because the wise man rests before
he is tired. Let us climb round this large
vegetable which is blocking the way and get
down to the creek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fought their way round the fallen
tree—it took them five minutes to do it: and
so came to where the brown water gurgled
and chattered over a bed of huge rounded
stones. Barry lay down with his face in a
pool, and drank as a dog drinks, inelegantly,
but thoroughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word, that’s good!” he said. “Have
some: I left plenty for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was kind of you,” said his father.
He produced from his pocket little collapsible
aluminium cups, and screwed them up,
offering one to Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are handy things,” he said.
“Sometimes they collapse at the wrong
moment, and it is very awkward, especially
if you are drinking coffee in a railway carriage.
Here, we should probably enjoy it,
so they won’t collapse. Sandwiches—yes,
please Robin, I think that is a very good
idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made a little parcel for our first halt,”
said Robin. “We ought to have lunch at
the Falls, if we have any luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could eat an enormous lunch now—and
at the Falls, too!” said Barry. “This is
a hungry stroll we’re taking!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supplies wouldn’t hold out,” said Robin,
practically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lay on the soft grass just above the
water’s edge and nibbled their sandwiches
economically, to make them last longer.
Below them a great veil of maidenhair
fern trailed downward to the stream that
washed its fronds: above towered the tall
brown shafts of tree-ferns, their spreading
crests mingling with sarsaparilla and
clematis. Just across the stream stood a
clump of Christmas-bush, already a starry
mass of white. There were birds everywhere
among the bushes, happy and
unafraid; bell-birds chimed ceaselessly in the
tree-tops far above them. Once, a wallaby
hopped upon an open space on the farther
bank, looked at them serenely for a moment,
and then hopped back into cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were right, Robin,” Dr. Lane said.
“We have not seen any bush like this—nothing
so quiet and utterly undisturbed.
It makes one feel oneself an intruder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d see lyre-birds if we could stay here
long enough without moving,” Robin said.
“Look—there’s a platypus!” She pointed
to a tiny promontory across the creek,
where a queer flat creature, furry and with
a bill like a duck’s, paused for a moment
before sliding head-first into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First I’ve ever seen,” commented Barry.
“My word this is a jolly place! I wish we
could have a camp here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll think about it next year, when we
come back,” said the doctor. “Meanwhile,
I’m afraid we had better move: we don’t
know how rough the going will be after
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were soon after to prove the melancholy
truth of the foreboding contained in
this remark. There was no track at all to
be found near the creek, and the banks were
so overgrown that each yard of progress
had to be fought. So they took to the water,
a slow process, since it was necessary to
follow the creek through all its windings:
a laborious one, because most of the way
was over smooth and slippery stones, where
each foothold had to be tested. All were
wearing rough spiked boots, which gave
them more security in treading; but they
also made walking tiring, when heavy with
water. The creek rarely rose above Barry’s
knees: but it was swift, the power of the
current increasing as they mounted higher
and higher into the hills; and it was hard
to gauge the depth of the pools. There was
more than one moment when Dr. Lane
asked himself doubtfully if they should give
up the attempt to reach the Falls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children, however, scouted the suggestion
indignantly. To have come so far,
and then to turn back, seemed to them an
unthinkable idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to do it once, and I’ve been sorry
ever since,” Robin declared. “And I wasn’t
fourteen then. We can’t be so very far
from the Falls now.” She peered ahead
into the dim tunnel of greenery—it was
long since they had seen the sun, shut in
by the trees as they were. “Look—I believe
it is a little clearer ahead. We might have
another try at walking on the bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see,” said Barry, eagerly. “Gee,
but my feet are sore from these old stones!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waded on as quickly as they could.
As Robin had thought, they came upon a
break in the dense wall of undergrowth.
There were signs of old axe-marks on some
of the trees, and many felled stumps, now
rotten and overgrown with creepers and
moss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably some old prospector lived
about here ages ago,” said Robin. “He’d
have to clear a way down to the water. This
is most likely his old track.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did they ever find gold here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—at least, only the merest traces.
But there are always fossickers about in the
hills who believe they will hit on gold some
day. Some people think that these hills hold
all sorts of things—marble, and limestone,
and valuable clays, and even oil. I suppose
they’ll be discovered by-and-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lark if we found an oil-well on
your place!” said Barry. “How does one
look for oil, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Other people do the looking, and then
they make you buy shares, my boy,” said his
father, gloomily. “I’ve lost more than I
care to think of in that way. The last oil-well
in which I was interested spouted only
hot water instead of oil, and so, much of my
hard-earned money went up in steam. I’ve
given up buying things I can’t see. Let us
try the old prospector’s clearing, and see if
it leads us to anything. We won’t go far
from the creek, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clearing was so overgrown that to
speak of it as cleared was only to distinguish
it from the impenetrable scrub on either
hand. Still, it was possible to find a way
through it; and presently, to their delight,
they came again upon the track, and saw,
through a rift in the timber, that they were
not far from the head of the gully where
the creek came down. They forgot fatigue
as they hurried onward, making light of the
many difficulties in the way: anything was
better than wading over the smooth round
stones that hurt the feet so cruelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, as they went, a sound came to
their ears: a low boom which at first they
took for the soughing of a far-off wind
coming across the tree-tops. It grew
louder as they advanced, almost unnoticed
by them: one does not lend a very attentive
ear to sounds, when one is fighting every
step of an uphill climb. But at length, in
a moment when the going was easier, it suddenly
brought Dr. Lane to a standstill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove!” he said, with a touch of
excitement unusual in him. “I believe that
is the noise of the Falls!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They halted, listening. The sound was a
dull, steady roar that never varied. Wind
and sea have light and shade in their stormy
note, but falling water comes with a ceaseless
and unalterable boom: a roar that has
lasted since time began, and will last down
the ages when the little races of men are
dust. There was no doubting the sound
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry gave a joyful cry and dashed
ahead. They heard him shout again as they
hurried after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The path ended in a wide space clear of
trees. On their left, the creek had broadened
out until it was a great pool; a whirlpool
of wild water that boiled and foamed and
eddied, before it rushed away over the stony
bed between the walls of scrub. Behind
it the hill rose sharp and rugged, a mass of
grey rocks, where mosses and lichen clung,
and stunted bushes struggled for a foothold.
A huge, rough mass showed near the top,
fifty feet above them: and over it, in a
smooth and glistening curve, lit by a dancing
rainbow where the sun’s rays struck
it, poured the waters of the Fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half-way down, the wonderful wall of
shining water was broken by a fang of rock
that jutted from the hillside. The fall split
upon it, shooting out on either side, to meet
again, lower down, so that the united curtain
flung its whole weight into the boiling
waters of the pool. But where it was cleft
by the jutting rock, a dancing curtain of
spray hung like a misty veil before it, catching
the rainbow light from above and multiplying
it into a myriad gleams of flying
colour. One might fancy one saw all the
fairies of air and water dancing in the opal
mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Robin—“oh!” She sat down
on the grass, hugging her knees, and stared
up as though she were worshipping. It was
long before any of them spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” said Dr. Lane at last—leaning
near her, because of the roar of falling
water. “It was worth the walk, don’t you
think, kiddies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They nodded: there was awe on each
young face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along,” Dr. Lane said. “We can’t
afford to wait too long, considering the
track home; and the billy must be boiled.
Let us get a little farther back, where we
can watch the Falls and hear ourselves
speak as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no one seemed to have much wish to
speak: the wonder of the Falls held them all
silent. They boiled their billy and ate
lunch under a big tree at the edge of the
scrub, saying little, but watching the dancing
mist-rainbows on the face of the water, and
the splendid curve above, like polished
black marble. Robin sighed heavily when
at length Dr. Lane gave the word to march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I was always sorry that I didn’t
see it,” she said. “But it was worth waiting
for. It’s like a dream, to take home for
keeps. If only I could make Mother see it
too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t know what is going to happen
next year,” Dr. Lane said, wisely. “If we
managed to camp where we halted to-day—and
found a man who could tell us more
about the track—and got the two Mothers
into hard condition by judicious exercise—who
knows what we may not arrive at! At
any rate we’ll have a try. Red Robin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barry, I think your Father is the nicest
ever!” said Robin, solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us news!” was Barry’s lofty
response.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE HUT IN THE SCRUB</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>They</span> were somewhat thoughtful as they
turned back into the scrub: a little awed by
the wonder they had seen—perhaps a little
sober at the remembrance of the long, rough
journey home. But there was something of
triumph in Robin and Barry, for they had
succeeded where others had failed. Many
tourists set out each summer for the Merri
Creek Falls, but the majority gave up the
journey, voting no waterfall worth the
trouble of getting through the forest in
which this particular fall chose to hide itself.
Few of the residents of the district had
reached the Falls—being a busy folk with
small leisure for scenery. And they had
won through! It was small wonder if Robin
and Barry felt a throb of exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached the place where they had
rejoined the track after their long wading
in the creek. Dr. Lane halted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if it would not be better to
keep to the track for a bit,” he said, rather
doubtfully. “If we could save ourselves
even half a mile of that unpleasant wading
it would be something. What do you think,
Robin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t fancy we should risk losing our
way,” Robin answered. “It must be the
only track, even if it seems to bend to the
north; there is no settlement of any kind
out here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do let’s try it for a bit,” begged Barry.
“My feet won’t stand too much of those
beastly stones; I’m sure I’ve sixteen blisters
already!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can try it for a while,” Dr.
Lane said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They followed the track, which almost
immediately became more definite. There
were signs that it had been used; light
scrub had evidently been roughly cut,
and once or twice Robin, who was leading,
thought that she could make out a footprint.
She pulled up, presently, and pointed
out a faint mark to Dr. Lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think a boot made that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks uncommonly like it,” Dr. Lane
answered. “There may be someone camped
near here: a prospector, or a fishing
enthusiast. It would be luck if we could
find someone who could tell us if we were
going out of our way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be a track left by the man you
were talking to,” Barry suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he was here last summer; no track
of his would be visible by this time. That
mark looked fairly new. Hullo—!” He
broke off suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The path had swung sharply round a
dense patch of dogwood, and they saw
before them, in a little open space, a rough
bark hut. It stood among a clump of
wattles, the trunks of which had been used,
so far as was possible, as supports. No
more crazy-looking building had ever
formed a home: it seemed to lean this way
and that, and where the heavy slabs of iron-bark
had warped under the weather it was
patched with whatever material the bush
afforded, and daubed with creek mud. Dr.
Lane gave a low whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We seem to have found our prospector,”
he said. “I hope the good man is at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man!” said Robin, staring. “It isn’t
only a man. Look there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed to where a rude clothes-line,
made of twisted stringy-bark, hung
between two trees. Something fluttered
from it: a woman’s dress of faded blue,
patched and torn. And as they looked, a
woman suddenly came round the corner of
the hut, and, seeing them, cried out and ran
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a very young woman, but her
face was lined and worn in a way that was
not good to see. Her faded hair was
strained back from a face so thin that it
looked almost like a mummy’s; her eyes
held a world of horror in their sunken
depths. Robin gave a gasp of pity and went
quickly to meet her, and the poor soul put
out a trembling hand, touching her sleeve
with a kind of incredulous delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A girl!” she muttered. “I thought I’d
never see a woman again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” Robin asked gently. “Can
we help you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m just desperate”—the low, strained
voice could hardly be heard. “I thought no
one ’ud ever come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not alone here?” Dr. Lane
asked sharply. She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me husband’s there. He’s dyin’, I think—he’s
been ill for weeks. We’d both have
been dead pretty soon.” Then she swayed,
and would have fallen, if they had not
caught her. They gave her a mouthful of
brandy and water, and in a minute she made
herself sit up and answer questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bit by bit the sorry little story came from
her halting tongue—long before it was
finished, Dr. Lane had gone off with long
strides to the hut, feeling for his pocket
medicine-case as he went. She and her
husband had come to the district as “married
couple” on a farm: they had heard wild
stories of gold to be found by fossickers and
prospectors along the Merri Creek, and
when they had saved a little money they had
given up their job and come out into the
bush. A farmer who knew the track had
brought them up on horses, a packhorse
carrying what outfit and stores they had
been able to buy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the first, bad luck had dogged them.
They were of the feckless kind that should
never leave a township; and the immensity
and the silence of the bush, and its impenetrable
nature, had filled their very souls
with fear. “We hated to look at it,” she
whispered—“only there wasn’t nothing else
to look at.” They had managed to burn
down their tent, losing a good deal of their
property. It seemed that they had expected,
in a vague way, to live chiefly on fish and
rabbits—and had found neither easy to get.
Not a speck of gold had rewarded their
pitiful seeking, although they had worked
together with aching backs and blistered
hands, cheering each other on with visions
of “striking it rich” any moment. And
then, just as they realized the uselessness of
their efforts, Jim, the husband, had fallen
ill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’ know what was the matter with
him,” she whispered. “We didn’t have no
medicine—it was all burned, the little bit
we had. He couldn’t eat nothing: I got a
rabbit twice, an’ once I caught a fish, but he
didn’t seem to fancy none.” For the last
three days he had scarcely moved or spoken,
and she was afraid to leave him. There was
no food left: there had been none for thirty-six
hours. “I knew he was dyin’,” the weak
voice whispered. “I just thought I’d lie
down an’ die too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robin!” The doctor’s voice was urgent,
and the girl ran to him as he stood in the
doorway of the wretched hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we any milk left?” he asked
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a bottle in Barry’s haversack,”
she said; “and a few sandwiches we kept
for the way home. Oh, and I’ve a cake of
milk-chocolate. I didn’t dare offer her anything
until I spoke to you. She’s starving,
you know.” Her voice caught in a sob.
“Is he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is her husband .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but not far off. Thank goodness I
had my medicine-case; and the milk may
help to pull him through. But it will be
touch-and-go. Get Barry to light a fire and
heat some water; we’ll make some chocolate
into a hot drink for her. I want all the
milk for the man. Don’t give her anything
solid yet.” He turned and went back into
the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty minutes later Robin had the satisfaction
of seeing a little colour coming back
into the blue lips as her patient sipped the
hot chocolate. She fed her with a spoon,
afraid that she might drink it too quickly.
The woman’s eyes had gleamed wolfishly at
the sight of the drink, but she was too weak
to be anything but docile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim,” she muttered. “Is Jim gettin’
any?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The doctor is looking after him,” Robin
told her, pityingly. “He is a very good
doctor: he will do everything he can for
him. We have a little milk, but we are
keeping it all for Jim.” And at that the
starved creature had given a great sigh of
relief, and tears had stolen weakly down her
face; it seemed that she had scarcely
strength left to weep. Robin made her lie
down when she had finished the chocolate,
promising her food soon. She pointed, as
she lay, to the torn blue dress hanging from
the stringy-bark line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t get me washin’ in,” she muttered,
as if in apology. “I rubbed it out in
the creek a week ago and hung it up. But
every time I put up me arms to get it down
I fainted right off. So at last I just leave
it stay there.” And at that, Robin, who had
been very calm and self-possessed, suddenly
burst out crying, to Barry’s infinite alarm.
She recovered herself in a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I was such a fool, old chap,” she
said, gruffly. “It seemed to knock me all of
a heap.” She went forward and unfastened
the poor little frock—it was pinned to the
line with thorns of prickly-Moses—and
folded it carefully: and the woman on the
grass watched her with wondering eyes
that were yet not wholly sane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Lane called Barry and Robin to him
after he had examined the wife briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll do: her heart and pulse are not
bad,” he said. “The man is a different
story, but I’m not without hope. Give me
every scrap of food or chocolate that we
have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very little store, and Barry
groaned over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think we were gorging, not half a
mile away!” he uttered. “I didn’t want my
last three sandwiches a bit, only it seemed
a pity to leave them. If only we’d known!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a mighty good thing we knew as
soon as we did,” said his father. “To-morrow
it would certainly have been too
late. And now, their main chance depends
on you two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked at him enquiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t leave them, of course,” he said.
“The man’s only hope lies in my being with
him, to give him medicine and stimulant at
the proper intervals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’re to get help?” Robin asked
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You’re sure you can get back
alone? I hate letting you go, but there’s no
help for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” said Barry and Robin,
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if this track is all right,” the
doctor said, uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woman says so. She told me twice,
pointing to it, that it was the track the
horses came. We’ll watch very carefully,
and there’s always the creek to guide us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—if you can get to it through the
scrub. Well, I can only hope it is safe:
you’re a better bushman than I am, Robin.
If you have not sent help out by this time
to-morrow I’ll start in myself, by the way
we came. Here’s a list of what I want—telephone
it into Baroin at the earliest possible
moment, and have the things sent out
by car. Merritt or some of the other
farmers will help you about getting
stretcher-bearers: we’ll need two stretchers
to bring them in, and plenty of relays of
bearers, in this awful country. Make them
start as early as they can; and you’ll have
to arrange for the ambulance from Baroin
to come as far as it can to meet the
stretchers. That young fellow at the
garage has sense: he will help, if you can get
on to him. Sure you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin nodded. “We’ll send out food and
fresh milk with the stretcher party as well
as the things you want from the township,”
she said. “You’ll be terribly hungry yourself
by that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove!” said Barry, staring; “it’s
pretty awful to think of you having nothing
to eat, Father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m well fed,” said the doctor,
lightly. “No need to worry about me. Now
be off, you two—and remember, I won’t
have an easy moment until I know how
you have got on. For goodness’ sake, don’t
lose the creek!” He smiled at them, letting
his hand rest on his boy’s shoulder for a
moment. Then he watched them as they
hurried into the bush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time the track was plain enough—steep
and stony, with sudden drops that
made them wonder sharply how men were
going to carry a stretcher down it—but not
densely overgrown. They were able to
make good progress. Then they came to
a place where a fallen tree had smashed
across it, and it was quite difficult to find the
path again in the mass of far-flung limbs;
they hated the loss of time while they cast
backwards and forwards. When, three
or four hundred yards farther on, the track
seemed to fork, Robin pulled up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like it, Barry,” she said. “There
may have been stray cattle here, making a
second trail, and how do we know where it
may lead us? The creek is beastly to walk
in, but at least it’s safe. I think we’d better
get down to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right-oh,” said Barry. “But can we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin put up her hand, listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I hear it, don’t you?” She
looked at the thick wall of scrub as one
looks at an enemy. “Come on: I guess we
can worm our way through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They wormed—if that term may be given
to a struggle that left both breathless.
Sometimes they tore aside stiff clumps of
dogwood twined thickly with creeping
plants: sometimes squeezed through the
closely-growing hazel and blanket-wood,
stepping downwards upon heaps of slender,
long-fallen trunks, so rotten, under their
covering of ferns, that at any moment a
foot incautiously planted might sink down
past the knee. They climbed over huge
fallen trees, deep-brown with damp moss or
slippery with wet—trunks on which it was
no easy matter to get a footing; where, once
gained, the slightest misstep might end in
a long slither and a broken ankle. They
could not see a yard ahead, in most places:
only, when they paused a moment to wipe
their dripping faces, the song of the creek
could be heard, far below, but always
coming a little nearer. Often it was easier
to crawl beneath a dead giant than to climb
over it, even if they had to dig a way
through. Nettles, tall and venomous, stung
their hands and faces: brambles and wild-raspberry,
and all the other hooked enemies
of the scrub tore at them unceasingly.
When at last they gained the creek, and,
plunging in thankfully, sat down on two
boulders, they looked at each other and
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re a pretty pair of scarecrows,” said
Robin. Barry chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are—if I look like you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re worse,” Robin assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their faces were almost unrecognizable
with heat and dirt and the brown dust of
fern-seed. Their clothes, torn in a hundred
places, hung about them in soiled tatters:
long, bleeding scratches showed beneath
many of the rents. They looked at each
other, panting, and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least we can have a drink and a
wash,” Robin said. “What a comfort to
think we needn’t mind getting wet!” She
knelt down in the nearest pool, and as the
stone on which she had chosen to kneel
decided to turn completely round, she fell
sideways into the water with a yelp and a
stupendous splash. Barry shouted with
laughter. She emerged, dripping, with an
air of pained surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said I didn’t mind getting wet, but this
is wetter than I meant,” Robin said. “Oh,
well, I’ll dry soon, and it’s very refreshing.”
They scrubbed their hands and faces,
dipping their heads under the hurrying
water, and coming up with gasps of satisfaction;
then they rubbed wet earth into
their burning nettle-stings, already showing
like angry weals upon the skin. Then, for
they dared not linger, they set off upon the
toilsome journey down the creek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as well that they had shortened it
by keeping to the track above, for their feet
were still sore from the wading of the morning,
and from being all day in soaked boots;
and each step was soon a torment. They
had not time to pick their way: the thought
of the three whom they had left in the lonely
camp whipped them forward, so that they
plunged recklessly over the slippery stones,
often losing their footing altogether. They
had joked over it in the morning, but there
was no joking now: it was hard enough
to keep from wincing or crying out as the
stones pinched and bruised their swollen
feet, while their bodies ached with the perpetual
effort to retain their balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s nearly over,” said Robin, as
she saw Barry lurch sideways, biting his
lip to restrain an exclamation of pain.
“Buck up, old chap—I believe we’re almost
at the tree where we took to the creek first
this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly good thing,” said the boy, trying to
speak lightly. “You must be pretty sick of
it, Robin—your boots are lighter than
mine.” He forced a grin. “Wouldn’t this
be great country for an aeroplane!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather—except when you wanted to
land.” She looked ahead, and gave a joyful
whistle. “There’s our tree!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they say all things come to an end,
but I was beginning to think that stretch
of creek had no finish,” said Barry, as they
climbed thankfully up the bank. “It’s all
plain sailing now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, thank goodness—and we can
hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was already evening as they made their
way along the rough path—rough as it was,
it felt smooth and grateful to their aching
feet. Robin led the way, keeping well
ahead, so that the lash of the held-back
branches should not sweep Barry’s face.
They did not speak until at length they came
out of the timber and saw, ahead, the cleared
hills and valleys that meant home. Then
Barry caught up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should we do first, Robin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must scatter,” Robin said. “You go
over to the Merritts’, Barry—you know the
way. They will pass the word round among
the farms in the hills on that side of the
creek; it will be best for the men to meet
there, for it’s the place nearest to the Falls
track. They are sure to start as soon as it
is light in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Will you go home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I’ll get Mother and Mrs. Lane to
drive down to Merri Creek at once: Mrs.
Lane can telephone for the things your
father wants while Mother is telling the
people there. Then I’ll cross our creek and
get over to O’Rourke’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nearly dark,” Barry said, looking
anxiously at the sky. “Will there be time
to get enough people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole district will know before
morning,” she said. “All the men about
here know what it will mean to get two
stretchers down the Falls track.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where will I go after I’ve told the
Merritts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home—and get those boots off as
quickly as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s doing so little, Robin. Can’t I
go on somewhere else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There won’t be any need,” Robin said—“unless,
of course, Mr. Merritt and the boys
are away. But they won’t be: they’ll be
milking. Oh, and tell them I’ll be over to
give the girls a hand with the cows in the
morning after the boys have gone. They
will send word on everywhere—one place
passes it to another, in a case like this.” She
looked at the boy’s dead-beat face, and
patted his shoulder. “You needn’t worry,
Barry, old chap. They’ll all know you’ve
done your bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” said Barry. “I haven’t done anything.”
He turned to go. “You won’t be
long, Robin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect to come straight home from
O’Rourke’s,” she said. “Don’t hurry too
much—there’s plenty of time to get things
ready by daylight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the men of the district did not wait
for daylight. It was not long after midnight
when the first relay of twenty men
set out—men who had no cows to milk, or
having cows, had wives and children who
could milk them. They carried food and
the drugs that Dr. Lane had ordered, and
they went on horses, so far as horses could
be forced through the scrub. They were
men who knew the track to the Falls—knew
that it was not necessary to wade the creek
as the Lanes and Robin had done. They
left their horses when the going became
impossible, and pushed onward on foot,
making the way clearer for those who should
follow: the sound of their axes echoed
through the quiet night, and their hurricane
lamps sent weird shafts of dim radiance to
startle the furry folk of the bush, who only
move after day has gone. It was scarcely
dawn when old David Merritt halted them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not more than a quarter of a mile
from the Falls,” he said. “Eight of us’ll
go forrard now: you other chaps stay here
and get your breath. We’ll want all the
breath you’ve got, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back at the settlement, riders had gone
to and fro all night, and men had climbed
where there was no footing for a horse in
the darkness: and always when the message
was given men made haste to pass it on, and
women packed food swiftly, catching their
breath to think of the woman who had
fought for her man’s life in the awful
loneliness of the wild bush. From the
little towns the lights of cars and buggies
gleamed in a long, broken procession, toiling
up the hill tracks with men, and yet more
men. Hill Farm was the central point: the
cars and buggies and horsemen turned in at
its gate unendingly, until the little flat
below the house was black with vehicles.
All night the house was a lit hive of
humming activity. Robin and Barry slept
the dreamless sleep of worn-out children on
the veranda, heedless of the passing feet;
but in the kitchen Mrs. Hurst and Mrs.
Lane, with other women, gave out great
mugs of tea and parcels of food, and the
men ate and drank swiftly before flinging
off their coats and following the figures that
streamed, ant-like, into the silent hills.
There were none left when dawn had come.
Even the men who had cows had yarded
them at two o’clock in the morning, and,
their milking done, were on their way
before the sun turned the eastern tree-tops
to copper and scarlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first men who carried the stretchers
did not last a quarter of a mile—old David
Merritt’s estimate had been over-sanguine.
Two hundred yards was enough, and more
than enough, for the strongest man in that
terrible descent through the bush, with the
dead weight of a helpless burden: feeling
with every step for roots and stumps in the
track, bending to avoid the clutching
branches, bracing each muscle suddenly to
avoid shock for the silent forms they carried,
when a sudden drop in the slippery path
flung them forward. They fell, more than
once: it was beyond human power always to
retain footing under their loads. But even
when they fell they did not try to save themselves—only
to ease the fall for the
stretchers. And one burden knew nothing,
wrapped in a heavy, drugged sleep: and to
the other, neither falls, nor weariness, nor
hunger mattered any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both all right?” had been the eager
question when the second relay had hurried
up in response to a whistle. David Merritt’s
headshake had been answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man’s gone, poor chap. Died in
the night. The woman’ll do, the Doc. says.”
He dropped his voice. “She don’t know
he’s gone. The Doc.’s put her to sleep. I’d
say carry her gently, boys, but it’s no darned
use!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no use, on that mountain pathway.
They changed bearers every hundred yards,
while those who were not carrying went
ahead to make the way easier with their
axes: and still, it was a journey of horror
until they had accomplished the first abrupt
descent, and of the twenty men, not one
but was thankful to sit down and rest. Dr.
Lane, heavy-eyed after his night of watching
and fasting, glanced beneath the blanket
that covered the woman’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll sleep through, I fancy,” he said.
“No need to hurry now, boys: the hurry was
for the poor fellow yonder.” His tone bore
the sadness of a man who has failed. “I
could have pulled him through if I had
found him twelve hours sooner, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We got here as quick as we could, Doc.,”
said a big, loose-limbed fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor’s eye kindled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were marvels!” he said. “I’m
hanged if I know how you did it in the dark—I
didn’t expect you until hours later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, that’s nothin’,” they said, awkwardly.
David Merritt lit his pipe and
pulled at it hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those youngsters,” he said, “They’re
good plucked ’uns if you like—both kids,
an’ one of ’em a girl! That boy of yours,
Doc.—come up to my place limpin’ and
runnin’, with his boots near cut from his
feet, an’ the blood runnin’ out of them.
An’ him a town kid. It was hard luck they
didn’t know the track; it would ’a’ saved
them miles of that cruel wading.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No joke, that wading isn’t,” said someone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it ain’t any joke. Gave his message
quite clear, the kid did, an’ then wanted to
go on to the next farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he go?” asked Barry’s father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if I knew it! All our work was
done, an’ there was plenty of us to send
messages. I put him on a pony an’ sent him
acrost to Hill Farm—he’d done enough for
any boy of his size.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Robin’s the same,” said big Tim
O’Rourke. “ ’Twas all I could do to make
her go home from my place. Gad, you
should ’a’ seen her: clothes cut to ribbons,
an’ her feet bleedin’ like the boy’s. I wanted
her to ride home. ‘No,’ says she, ‘you’ve
only got one pony an’ you’ll need him!’
True enough, too, but I reckoned she needed
him more. But she off down the hill before
I could so much as get a bridle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Town or country, I reckon them two
are darned good Aussies!” said a returned
soldier. A murmur of assent went round
the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David Merritt put his pipe carefully into
his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time for another shift, boys,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was mid-afternoon before the last relay
of bearers came steadily across the Hill
Farm paddock towards the motor-ambulance
that waited—brought by a cunning
driver over ground where it is safe to say
its builders had never dreamed that it could
go. There was a little crowd about it: a
silent crowd, for word of what they bore
had gone before them, and if there were
pride in the life snatched from the bush it
was hushed into speechlessness in the
presence of Death. The men took off their
hats as the ambulance moved off slowly:
here and there a woman sobbed. Big Tim
O’Rourke, who had been first and last to
carry, stretched his great shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor chap!” he said. “He done his best.
Well, boys, I reckon it’s about time to get
home to milk!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CONCERNING THE END OF A PIG</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>Coming</span> out, Robin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too hot, I think,” Robin said, lazily.
“Where do you want to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, anywhere. What’s the good of staying
in the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see much good in going out,
either, in this weather. There isn’t a trout
in the creek that would rise, on a day like
this, and you know you wouldn’t get a shot
at a rabbit until the evening. Unless you
want to be like all the other tourists, and
shoot parrots and jackasses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a calculated insult, and Barry
responded by a well-aimed cushion. Robin
caught it deftly and tucked it under her
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks: I just wanted that. Barry, why
can’t you read a book nicely like a good
little boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’m not one, I expect,” said
Barry, truthfully. “I was one, once, before
I came here—but two months of your
society have had an awful effect on me.
And I have read all the books I want to, and—I
say, Robin, how about a swim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that is not such a foolish idea,”
Robin said. “In fact, it seems the most possible
thing to do, since you won’t let me
read quietly. But I must get afternoon tea
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll help you,” he said. He disappeared
violently from the veranda, and she heard
the clatter of the kettle against the kitchen
tap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>January was nearly over, and Barry was
still an inmate of Hill Farm. Indeed, he
could hardly be called a mere inmate, so
much had he become a member of the
family. His father and mother had
returned from their Queensland trip, and
had kindly invited him to return home, but
the invitation had not been a command, and
Barry had begged that he might remain
where he was. Melbourne in mid-January
made no appeal to him: nearly all his
friends would be out of Town, having fled
to the hills or the seaside, and he saw a
dreary vision of hot streets with dusty tram-cars
crawling up and down them. If Mrs.
Hurst would have him—and Mrs. Hurst
had nobly refrained from making any objection—why
might he not stay at Hill Farm
until school once more drew him into its
relentless clutch? And since Dr. and Mrs.
Lane had no sufficient answer to this query,
at Hill Farm he had stayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin and he were inseparable chums, on
a purely boyish footing. There was rarely
any question of leadership on Barry’s part:
he had learned from the first that he had
to defer to Robin’s superior knowledge, and
to adapt his days, if he wanted her companionship,
to her occupations. It was
fortunate for him that these occupations
were rarely of a feminine nature. He was
too active to remain unemployed while she
worked; therefore it came about that while
she milked Bessy he fed pigs, and while
she trained runner beans in the way they
should go, he dug potatoes—since, if they
were to have time to play, work must be done
first. Because they were young, and often
very feather-headed, it was true that the
work was not infrequently scamped; the
garden was by no means the place of shining
neatness that it had been in November,
and it was possible, with the naked eye, to
find weeds flourishing among the rows of
vegetables. The painting of the garden
fence had never been completed. The allies
had, indeed attacked it, taking each one side,
and had worked until the eastern half was
done; then it had seemed a rather dreary
prospect to begin upon the western half,
and by mutual consent the work had been
put aside until there was nothing better to
do—a period that did not seem likely to
arrive while Barry remained at Hill Farm.
There were always so many things more
interesting that clamoured for their attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got into mischief, too, sometimes,
and played pranks which called for intervention
on the part of Mrs. Hurst; it was
not to be expected that the “red-headed
streak” in Robin would remain dormant
with a companion as light-hearted as herself.
Things that should have been done
were forgotten, and there had been one or
two occasions when the mother had been
angry—such as the night when they had
slipped out ’possum-hunting at midnight,
had lost themselves in the gullies, and had
not managed to get home until long after
breakfast-time: when they arrived, penitent,
but with an irrepressible air of having had a
good time. But it was all straightforward
mischief; and even when Mrs. Hurst was
annoyed, it was with a half-hidden sense of
relief that Robin was not growing old too
soon. There had been something almost
unnatural in the Robin who had worked
early and late, had never forgotten anything
that she should remember, and had been
quite content to adapt her life to her
mother’s standpoints. After all, she was
only a child, still; and Mrs. Hurst was one
of those who believe that childhood cannot
always sit up and behave prettily, if it is to
develop on the right lines. She had
sorrowed because Robin seemed likely to
have none of the ordinary irresponsible joy
of life. Unquestionably, she was arriving
at a good deal in Barry’s society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, too, it would not last. Barry must
soon go, and then there would be nothing
for Robin but to slip into the old routine,
finding most of her enjoyment in work
about the place. Then, probably, the western
half of the fence would receive a seemly coat
of paint, and Hill Farm would no longer
look lop-sided; hours for meals would
become splendidly regular, the garden
would be weeded, and the milk-bucket be
polished again with monkey-soap until it
resembled silver. There would be no more
pranks and mischief: no gay shouts echoing
over the hills. “And I shall wish all the
time that she had a playmate again,” Mrs.
Hurst admitted to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another inmate now at Hill
Farm—the forlorn little widow of poor
“Jim,” who had ended his ineffectual life in
the camp by the Falls. Polly had been
nursed back to health in the hospital in
Baroin; but with physical health full mental
balance had not returned, and she would
probably go through life gentle and uncomplaining,
but never with complete realization
of all that had happened to her. Public
sympathy had been excited over her case:
a subscription for her benefit had resulted
in a fairly large sum, and kindly women had
united in supplying her with an outfit of
clothes. She did not know that her Jim
was dead: that was something the hurt
mind failed to grasp. He was away, she
told people: gone away prospecting into the
hills—he would be back for her as soon
as he found gold. She did not seem to
worry about Jim. But from the moment
she had regained consciousness in the hospital
she had begged for Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not, of course, know who Robin
was—did not even know her name, or why
she wanted her. “The red-haired one,”
she entreated, again and again, until the
Baroin doctor, in despair, had motored out
to Hill Farm and brought Robin to the
hospital—when immediately the poor thing
was content. Probably it was because
Robin had been the one who had run to
meet her at the camp: the first person who
had brought a ray of encouragement to
her hopeless misery. She remembered how
the girl had fed her with a spoon; she told
the story again and again to the nurses.
When Robin went away she was restless
and uneasy, asking for her continually.
The matter had been finally settled by the
Benevolent Society, which had agreed with
Mrs. Hurst to take charge of her for a
small weekly payment: and so Polly had
come for three months to Hill Farm, where
she pottered happily all day at small tasks,
perfectly content if Robin now and then
spared her a cheery word, and always watching
for a chance to do her some small
service. She liked Mrs. Hurst, and was
always gentle and docile with her. But
Robin was the sun of her existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cool weather had ended with Christmas.
For over a month no rain had fallen, and
the paddocks had dried up rapidly, changing
from green to yellow within a few days.
All the creeks were shrinking, with the
exception of Merri Creek, which, fed from
its mysterious source above the Falls, had
never been known to fail: the others were
mere chains of holes, so that there was no
water in some of David Merritt’s paddocks.
It was a hard season for a district that
depended mainly on dairying. The milk-yield
began to fall off, so that the cheques
from the butter-factory dwindled even as
the water dwindled in the creeks: the
gardens suffered, and the farmers whose
houses were not well equipped with tanks
were already carting water for their households—a
strenuous task in country so hilly
and rough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here and there, fires broke out during
the last week of January: but settlers were
fully alive to the risk they ran, and every
outbreak had been fought and beaten before
it could spread. Back in the ranges, however,
fires were burning: the men of the
district watched them anxiously, with grim
predictions of what might happen should
strong winds bring the blaze down towards
the valleys. There were deep-voiced threats
against any man who should dare to burn
off his cut scrub, with the whole country as
dry as tinder and dead grass as thick as a
crop in every paddock. “If a fire does come
our way,” David Merritt said, “there’ll be
no earthly use in fighting it. It’ll be a case
of make for the nearest hole in the creek,
and be thankful if you get out of it alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they always talk like that,” one
farmer’s wife said to Mrs. Hurst. “There’ve
been other years as dry, with the grass
as thick: but even if a fire started they
always manage to stop it. And most prob’ly
rain’ll came soon.” That was the comforting
belief: that rain would come soon. But
the sun sank each evening in a sky of angry
red; and day after day of breathless heat
succeeded nights that, for Gippsland, were
extraordinarily hot: Gippsland being a
place where hot nights are almost unknown.
And still rain seemed as far off as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon when Barry had been so
uncomfortably full of energy was a stifling
one: and though his suggestion of a bathe
in the creek was enticing, Robin viewed
with no pleasure the prospect of the walk
across the paddock. However, since he had
rushed off to put on the kettle for tea, she
felt that she could no longer lie down: and
as the bed was hot and her book one that
she had read twice before, she was able to
be the more philosophic about getting up.
She went out to the kitchen to find Barry
sitting on the table discoursing to Polly,
who greeted her with a delighted smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Miss Robin. Isn’t he a funny
boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” said Robin. “What has he
been doing now, Polly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Been telling me stories,” said Polly.
“Funny stories. I like your stories best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you do,” said Robin, laughing
at Barry’s disgusted face. “I’ll tell you
about Cinderella after tea, if you like—when
he is out of the way.” For Polly
loved stories, and would listen to the
simplest fairy-tale, told over and over, with
the most perfect delight. It was no unusual
thing for her to crouch near Robin as she
worked in the garden, listening, with parted
lips and shining eyes, while Robin told her
“The Three Bears,” or some other nursery
classic, between strokes of her hoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw such rotten taste!” said
Barry, disgustedly. “I’ve been telling her
a gorgeous yarn I read about some Boy
Scouts who got off with an aeroplane—but
I believe it’s all double-Dutch to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—double-Dutch!” said Polly, chuckling
to herself over the phrase. “Funny
little boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, I say—who are you calling little?”
demanded Barry, justly indignant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Double-Dutch little boy,” crooned Polly,
softly. “Double-Dutch little boy!” The
words pleased her, and she drifted out of
the kitchen, still singing them softly. Barry
laughed, but there was pity in the laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor soul!” he said. “She’s just
awfully funny, but what a shame it all is.
She’d be a jolly nice little woman if she
hadn’t had that cruel time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she’s that now,” said Robin.
“There never was anyone kinder, and she’s
very capable and sensible in lots of ways.
Only, just like a little child.” She sighed.
“You know, I can’t bear to think of her
after she leaves here: they are going to put
her in some Home or other, and she’ll simply
hate it. She can’t stand being within four
walls—do you notice she always wanders
out of a room after a few minutes? She
told me once that something would hurt her
if she stayed in a room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer idea,” said Barry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, isn’t it? And she loves the hills:
she often sits on a stump in the paddock
and looks at them for an hour at a time.
I wonder does she think Jim is in them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t wonder—poor soul. She
never asks for him, does she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—she just says he’s coming back
when he finds gold. But she will hate to
be in a place with high walls in a city. I
think she may begin to fret for Jim then.
Mother and I wish we could keep her here,
but I suppose it’s out of the question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a tremendous tie,” Barry
remarked. “You could never leave her
alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No: it hasn’t mattered yet, but of course
it might be a difficulty. Anyhow, we
couldn’t afford it. What a blessed nuisance
money is! it’s always interfering with what
one wants to do. If I could find a gold-mine
Mother and I wouldn’t have any
worries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have to manage the miners, and
they’d always be going on strike,” said
Barry, wisely. “Anyhow, you get a heap of
fun out of life, without a gold-mine. There!
that old kettle is boiling at last: I was
getting so hot I thought I should boil before
it did! When I strike my own mine, Robin,
I’m going to have an electric plant put in
here, so’s you can cook by electricity instead
of that hot old wood-stove.” He filled the
teapot, and then discovered that he had
not put in any tea, at which he was justifiably
annoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mind is too set on high projects,”
laughed Robin, preparing the tray swiftly.
“Never mind—you boiled three times as
much water as we need; pitch it out, and the
teapot will be as hot as Mother likes it to
be, which is one good thing. Cake or biscuits?
You can’t have bread-and-butter,
’cause all the butter is down the well. It
was fast turning to oil this morning, so I
put it down the well in a Mason jar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cake and biscuits, please,” said Barry.
“Where’s your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lying down—she promised me, after a
heated argument, that she would lie down
until after five o’clock. I’m going to take
this tray to her.” She went to the door and
called softly. “Polly! Are you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss Robin.” Polly came hurrying,
her face alight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s your tea. Would you like to take
it into the yard, in the shade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, please, Miss Robin. I like the
yard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. There’s a big piece of cake
for you, and two biscuits—don’t let that
funny boy get them!” Polly laughed
delightedly, and scuttled into the kitchen;
and Robin went off with her mother’s tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going for a swim, and we want to
try to get some rabbits afterwards, Mother,”
she said. “Does it matter if we’re late for
tea? I’ll get it when we come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t matter at all,” said Mrs.
Hurst. “I don’t think anyone will be in a
hurry for tea on such an evening. But
don’t knock yourself up, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. Anyhow, we won’t be really
late, because there is so much smoke about
that we shan’t be able to shoot once the sun
goes down. So I need not milk and feed
until we come in. You won’t do it yourself,
you bad old mother?—promise! Barry
will help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, I won’t,” Mrs. Hurst said.
“Is Polly all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I’ll tell her not to go out of the
yard. Well, I must go and get my tea, or
Barry will have eaten all the cake.” She
blew a merry kiss to her mother, and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set off presently across the paddock,
Polly straining wistful eyes after their
retreating figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew-w, it’s hot!” whistled Barry.
“Queer, wicked sort of heat—makes a chap
feel all anyhow. This is the first day I’ve
wanted to be back in Melbourne. Not that
I want Melbourne: I don’t—but I want the
sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I don’t see why you want the old
Melbourne sea—that’s only the Bay.”
Robin made disdainful answer. “It’s all
used-up water. I’d rather have the Ninety-Mile
Beach; great tumbling breakers as far
as ever you can see each way, and a big
lovely stretch of sand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry disagreed with this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it’s good,” he said. “But I want
a place where you can dive. I like to get
high up above the water and look right down
into it, and then just shoot below! And
then have room to swim under water: you
can dive in some of the creek-holes, but the
mud below spoils them. There’s a jetty at
Inverloch where I used to dive—gorgeous
place, with a good stiff current racing past,
out to sea. That’s fun, if you like!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, I like mine without currents,”
Robin laughed. “Anyhow, you will have to
put up with the creek this afternoon, ’cause
its all we’ve got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky to have it,” was Barry’s comment
“I’ll race you in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had arrived at their swimming-hole,
a deep still place where the creek widened
among lofty grey rocks. One formed a
shelf that jutted over the deepest part: and
when Barry had emerged from his dressing-nook
he ran out upon it, standing bare-headed,
a muscular, sturdy figure in his
scanty swimming-suit. He sent a defiant
crow in the direction of Robin, who had not
yet appeared, and then bent forward, cleaving
the air in a neat dive. A mighty
splashing startled Robin, as she ran out,
and she looked down to see him swimming
wildly across the pool. Gaining the nearest
rock he pulled himself out, and gave an
excited shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t come in! Ugh! I dived on top
of a snake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barry! It didn’t bite you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I scared it too much.” He was
scanning the water sharply. “There it is—see
him, Robin? He’s swimming towards
that little patch of sand between the rocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see him,” Robin said. “Nice of him to
come out my side, if only I can get a stick
in time. Watch him, Barry—don’t take
your eyes off him.” She scrambled down
the rocks, wincing as sharp edges caught
her bare feet; and then turned back to her
dressing-hole. “The gun is quicker,” she
observed, in answer to Barry’s impatient
shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran out on the ledge with her gun
just as the snake crawled out of the water
upon the warm stretch of sunny sand. He
liked the feel of it, and decided to stay
a moment: a decision that was immediately
his undoing. The report of the gun shattered
the stillness, and what was left of the
snake writhed feebly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good man!” said Barry, happily. “That
fellow won’t go bathing again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither will I, until we have a good look
round,” said the lady with the gun. “No
fun in bathing with snakes. Get your boots
on, Barry, and we’ll make sure his mate is
not about.” They beat the bushes with
sticks, poked into every crevice, and finally
decided that to bathe was safe; and being,
by this time, extremely hot, bathed for a
very long while, without giving another
thought to the possibility of snakes—which,
indeed, would scarcely have ventured into
the excited waters of the pool when people
as energetic as Robin and Barry were disporting
themselves in it. Finally, having
dressed with reluctance, they pondered on
what should be their next step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too early to shoot,” Robin said. “There
won’t be many rabbits about, anyhow: the
heat and the smoke will keep them in their
burrows. That fire up in the ranges must
be getting bigger, Barry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The smoke is certainly worse,” Barry
remarked. “I hope the old fire stays where
it is, that’s all.” He dived into the little
canvas bag in which he carried his cartridges,
and produced something wrapped
in paper. “Know what that is, Robin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Robin: “I don’t. Rum-looking
stuff. What is it, Barry? Soap?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry regarded with a proud eye the
stick of putty-like substance he had
unwrapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soap!” he said, scornfully. “I don’t
cart yellow soap about with me, you silly!
That’s gelignite.” He tossed up the plug
and caught it, and Robin gave a cry of
alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You idiot, Barry! Do take care—it
might go off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So might you,” was Barry’s impolite
response. “Gelignite doesn’t go off like
that—you’ve got to have a detonator, and
fuse. I’ve got ’em, too.” He took from his
bag a length of thick black cord, and a small
tin box, handling the latter with considerable
respect. It contained an innocent-looking
little copper tube, closed at one end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the detonator,” he explained.
“You stick the end of the fuse into it and
nip the tube with pliers so’s she can’t slip
out. Then you shove the closed end of the
detonator down into the gelignite, and
everything’s ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how does it go off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you put the gelignite where you
want to blast things, and light the fuse: it
burns at the rate of about a foot a minute.
Soon as she begins to sputter, you know
she’s properly alight, and then you scoot as
hard as you can lick. And then—bang!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin regarded the expert in explosives
with something akin to reverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you find out all about it?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I used to see the men blasting when
they were making a new railway line one
year when we went to Queensland,” said
Barry. “They’d always let me watch until
just before they lit the fuse. I found this
outfit in one of the sheds, high up on a
beam—it was in an old biscuit-tin. Must
have belonged to your Uncle Donald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would he do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, lots of men use it for getting rid of
old stumps and trees. So I collared it,
because I had a great idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” demanded Robin. “Tell me,
Barry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry regarded her in silence for a
moment, his head on one side, like an
inquisitive bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought we could have no end of a lark
with it,” he said. “I’ve seen the men using
it so often, and I’ve always wanted to have
a bit myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But isn’t it awfully dangerous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit,” said Barry, airily, “if you
know how to use it. Of course, in any
ordinary place, and with the country as dry
as it is, it wouldn’t do. But you know that
rocky place up at the head of that gully—”
he jerked his hand towards the hills.
“There’s nothing but rocks there and mossy
stuff and bare earth—not much earth,
either. A few ferns sticking among the
lumps of rock. It would be perfectly safe
there. Let’s go and try it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat back on his heels and looked at her
with an impish expression of joy in his plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it would be safe,” Robin said.
“The walls of the gully are so steep, and
there is no grass there to be set on fire—only
a few clumps of bracken, and we could
watch them.” Her eye began to kindle. “It
would be rather a lark!” she said. “But I
wonder what Mr. Merritt would say. He
rents that part, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it won’t hurt him. We’ll hunt any
of his cows out of the gully, if they’re there.
If he hears the bang, and says anything
about it, we’ll tell him, of course. I expect
he’s used any amount of the stuff himself,
blasting out stumps.” Barry jumped up.
“Come along, Robin, old chap!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Robin said, recklessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurroo!” cried Barry. “I knew you’d
be a sport. You’re nearly as good as a boy!”
He capered down the rocks ahead of her,
and they set off on their way to the gully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an ideal spot for such a lawless
enterprise. The gully was a short one,
running back between two great rocky hills
that were almost bare of timber. At the
closed end the walls of rock were very lofty:
they could be fairly certain that no flying
fragments of stone could reach the top. No
stock were to be seen: all the ground was
littered with half-buried boulders, among
which patches of withered bracken clung.
A few rabbits scurried away as they came
in sight; but the children were far too
excited to think of shooting. The sight,
however, gave Robin a flash of common
sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll leave the guns and all our
cartridges here,” she said, halting beside a
big tree near the entrance to the gully—the
only tree that grew there. “Put them on
this side, and nothing will be likely to touch
them when you blow that old cliff to bits!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Barry agreed. “I prospected
this place yesterday, you know; there’s a
sort of cave between those two great rocks
over yonder, and we can hide there while
we’re waiting for the bang. Nothing could
hit us—it’s as safe as a dugout.” He
pranced along, almost running, to the end of
the gully, where they halted—two little
figures under the walls of frowning grey
rock. “That’s the bit of stone I want to
shift,” he said, pointing upwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin looked. A big square rock jutted
sharply from the face of the cliff, with a
mass of loose boulders under it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d give my hat to blow that big chap
out!” declared Barry, excitedly. “There’s a
cleft right behind him, on top—I can just
get my hand in, up to the elbow. Gelignite
shatters downwards, you know: I want to
get the plug well down into that cleft. It’s
a perfectly gorgeous place for the charge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it couldn’t do any harm, that I can
see,” Robin said. “As long as you’re sure
we have time to get out of the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, whips of time! How do you suppose
the men manage when they’re using
this stuff every day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They know more about it than I do,”
was Robin’s sage comment. “But I suppose
it’s all right: I’m game to chance it, anyhow.
Carry on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She climbed up beside him, and explored
for herself the hole where the charge was to
go, and watched him place it in position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you clear!” he told her. “No sense
in our being in each other’s way when we’re
scrambling down these rocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose there isn’t,” she said, unwillingly.
“But oh, Barry, do be careful!
Suppose you slipped and hurt an ankle or
something when you’re getting down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much more likely to do it if I’ve a girl
blocking the way!” said the lordly male.
“But I’m not going to do any such fat-headed
thing. I know what I’m about. Cut,
now, Robin, and I’ll set her going!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin scrambled down the rocks, noting,
with some relief, that the way was easy.
Further she would not go, alone: she waited,
with her heart beginning to beat heavily
until Barry followed her, with amazing
speed, and together they ran like frightened
hares to their “dugout.” As they passed
the largest patch of bracken they heard a
quiet, satisfied grunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder if that’s a wombat?” panted
Barry. “Well, he’s going to get the shock
of his life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached their cave and crawled
thankfully into its shelter. A split in the
rock gave them a peep-hole, and they looked
out anxiously. As they did so, two plump
forms emerged from the ferns, still grunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my sainted Aunt!” groaned Barry.
“Robin, they’re Merritt’s young pigs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barry!” screamed Robin. “I’m going to
hunt them!” She wriggled back, and the
boy caught her sleeve in a tight grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You silly ass!” he panted. “Keep back!
I wouldn’t let you go out there for fifty
pigs! Keep your head down, I tell you,
Robin, you old——”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Bang!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The explosion burst upon their ears with
shattering force. Never was such a noise—the
walls of the gully, closing it in, seemed
to rock with its deafening thunder. The
great mass of rock shot from the face of
the cliff, flying into a hundred pieces. Shattered
fragments strewed the ground, banging
and clattering on their protecting
crags. One little pig uttered an ear-piercing
shriek, and fled for the open country, his
shrill notes of protest dying away in the
distance. The other disappeared beneath a
hurtling mass of stone.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo230.jpg' alt='' id='illo230' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>“Keep back!”</p>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Barry burst into a shout of excited
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my goodness, Robin, did you see
him! Won’t there be a jolly row! A big bit
of rock just sailed through the air, and absolutely
flattened him—he never knew what
hit him. And the pig was not! Just listen
to his brother—he’s got shell-shock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They scrambled out of their hole, and
gazed at the slab of stone, from which protruded
a melancholy curly tail. It was
mercifully clear that the deceased pig could
not have known what hit him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’ll have to tell Mr. Merritt,”
said Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. I’ll pay him for poor
piggy. Well, he shouldn’t have hidden in
that bracken until it was too late. Anyhow,
he died gloriously on the field of battle, and
it’s better than living to be made into pork
sausages. Wasn’t it a topping blast! Come
and see what it has done to my rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smoke of the explosion still lingered
about the head of the gully, mingling with
air already murky with bush-fire smoke; but
they could see that the charge had done its
work very thoroughly. Not only was the
big rock gone, shattered to pieces, but the
whole face of the rocky wall, for many
feet, had been split off: the new, clean-looking
stone showed curiously against the
weathered and moss-grown stretch on
either side. They looked at it respectfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ve made our mark,” Robin said,
at length. “No sign of burning anywhere,
is there, Barry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They searched carefully, but found no
trace of fire: the explosion had confined
itself to the head of the gully, save for
the flying fragments. Mr. Merritt’s pig
remained the one sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Told you I knew all about it,” said
Barry, triumphantly. “I vote we go home
now: shooting rabbits would be too tame
altogether after a bang like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Robin agreed. She looked
curiously at the stretch of newly-exposed
stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that pretty rock?” she observed.
“It’s got such queer colours and markings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what a girl would say!” was Barry’s
scornful rejoinder. “It’s only old rock: I
don’t see anything pretty about it. But the
bang was gorgeous, if you like! I’m going
to be an engineer when I grow up—they
always have lots of blasting rocks in their
jobs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they always kill pigs?” asked Robin,
cruelly.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch12'>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>STRANGERS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> seemed to Mrs. Hurst that the evening
grew hotter as sundown approached,
and the atmosphere more oppressive. The
blue haze drifting slowly down from the
ranges made all the air heavy: it had spread
gently over the landscape, so that distant
objects were misty and indistinct. Since
this was not unusual in summer-time, when
fires were constantly burning in the distant
ranges, it had caused no anxiety to the
settlers in the valleys below. But as Mrs.
Hurst strolled out into the garden, weary
of the hot house, she cast an apprehensive
glance upwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe it is thicker than it was this
morning,” she said, half aloud. “I wonder—if
the wind should get up—” She
did not put the partly-formed thought into
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in the garden the feeling of being
shut in oppressed her, and presently she
opened the white gate and strolled slowly
down the slope towards the road. There
was a log close to the fence; she sat down
on it, looking across the paddocks towards
the green line of wattles that marked the
winding course of the creek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish the children would come home,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the hills a loud booming noise came
as if in answer, and she started violently,
while the echoes ran round the gullies:
laughing at herself as they died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only the road-gang blasting somewhere,”
she said. “I believe I am getting
nervous. This long spell of dry heat makes
us all jumpy. If only rain would come—!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sharp creaking sound, faint at first, but
gradually drawing nearer, made her look
round; and presently, a bend in the road
showed a queer, unwieldy object looming
through the haze. It revealed itself, coming
closer, as a light cart, drawn by an old
chestnut horse that hung its head, shuffling
wearily through the dust as though its load
had drained it of every particle of energy
it had once possessed. Piled high on the
cart was furniture: stretchers and bedding,
a kitchen-table, a battered meat-safe, and
a few rough chairs, with wooden boxes
filled with hastily-packed odds and ends.
Two dirty children of five and six years old
were perched in corners among the load.
Beside the horse—it was clearly not necessary
to guide it in any way—walked a
woman, covered with dust, and carrying a
younger child. She stumbled often as she
walked, never lifting her face. At intervals
she said, mechanically, “Gee up, Bawly!”—a
remark which had no effect whatever upon
the chestnut horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The creaking that had first attracted Mrs.
Hurst’s attention came from the off-wheel.
The sound was rapidly growing more acute,
rising to a long-sustained screech that was
the clearest possible demand for more oil:
but the woman trudging by the horse’s head
did not seem to notice it. A step sounded
near Mrs. Hurst, and she glanced round, to
meet Danny’s friendly gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evenin’, Mrs. Hurst,” he said. “I jus’
come over to see if yous was all right. Been
a cow of a day, hasn’t it?—an’ the smoke’s
thicker than ever. Wonder who them
travellers are? They’ll have a hot axle if
they don’t watch it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just thinking that, Danny,” Mrs.
Hurst said. “Poor things, how tired they
look!” She opened the gate and went out
into the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-evening,” she said, gently. “Your
wheel is very stiff, isn’t it? Won’t you rest
here for a few minutes while I get you some
oil for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman had started violently at her
voice. The chestnut horse pulled up thankfully,
and dropped his nose yet farther
earthwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I been thinkin’ it wouldn’t get us much
farther,” she said, dully. “Trouble is, I
don’t know how much farther we got to
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you come far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of the hills,” she nodded vaguely
backward. “We been on the track all day.
Any township near here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for two miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two mile!” It was clear that it might
as well have been twenty, by her hopeless
look. “Well, we got to get on. Gee up,
Bawly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but you can’t!” Mrs. Hurst cried.
“You—are you going to friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. We don’t know anyone round
here. We come out of the hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are not going any farther,”
Mrs. Hurst said, quietly. “Just turn your
horse in through this gate. Will you open
it, Danny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Danny had it open before she had finished
speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better not try ’n’ get the load up the
hill before I grease that axle,” he said. “I’ll
slip up an’ get some grease.” He took the
rein, and led the tired horse through the
gateway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we can’t stay here—four of us,”
the woman said. “I thought there’d be a
pub somewheres: I got money, y’ know,
Missus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I wouldn’t let you go another
yard!” Mrs. Hurst answered. “You look
just tired out, all of you. Sit down on this
log for a few minutes before you walk up
the hill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman sank on the log with a sigh
of relief, and the heavy baby in her arms
woke and cried. Mrs. Hurst leaned down
and took it out of the mother’s arms.
Danny had already lifted the children out
of the cart: they stood by the wheel, holding
each other’s hands, too shy to move, and
half-inclined to cry, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word, it’s good to sit down!” said
the woman. “You’re awful kind, Missus.
It’s too bad, loafin’ on you like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would have been too bad if I had not
happened to see you,” replied Mrs. Hurst.
“There—isn’t she a good baby!”—as the
baby, deciding that she liked the change of
arms, ceased crying and looked about in an
interested way. A half-smile flickered on
the weary mother’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s been jolly good, considerin’ she
ain’t a year old,” she said. “But it’s been
a long day for all of ’em, an’ I was afraid
to stop long anywhere. It’s a bit rough,
when you don’t know the country an’ you
ain’t got any idea where you’re goin’. Is
this near Baroin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no: Baroin is twelve miles away.
But you need not worry any more: you can
stay here until you are all rested. What
brings you and the bairns alone on the
track?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me husband made us come. He an’ his
brother have a sawmill back there; jus’ got
it well goin’. But we got fair scared of the
fires: they been creepin’ nearer and nearer,
an’ if the wind changed they’d be down on
our camp before you could say knife. I’d ’a’
stuck it out with them if I’d been by meself.
But there’s the kids.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no one near you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. There’ll be a road up after a bit:
there’s only a track through the bush now,
an’ the timber’s awful thick all round us.
Great timber for millin’, of course, but you’d
be roasted alive if a fire come through it.
There ain’t nowhere to get to, you see.
There’s a bit of a creek, but it’s that small
it ’ud be no use to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your menfolk? Is it safe for them
to stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe?” was the dull answer. “No, it’s
darned unsafe. Y’ wouldn’t catch me
leavin’ but for that. I didn’t want to go,
anyhow. But Mick made me. ‘Bill an’ I
can put up a fight for the mill,’ he says, ‘but
I’m darned if we can fight for the kids, too.
So you got to clear out with the kids,’ he
says. ‘You take the furnitcher an’ the kids,
an’ you clear out o’ the timber.’ An’ I
knew that was sense, so I done it. But I
tell you straight, Missus, I’d like to dump
the kids somewhere an’ go back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t do that,” Mrs. Hurst said,
gently. “Your husband would only be more
anxious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ what about me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst had no answer for that
question. She glanced away from the
haggard misery of the other woman’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just come up to the house, all of you,
and let me take care of you,” she said. “The
wind may not change, and we may get rain
at any time—why, your Mick might be
down looking for you in a day or two.
Come and I will make you some tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word, I could do with a cup o’ tea,”
the woman said. “The poor kids, too—!”
She beckoned to the two small boys, who
had never stirred. “C’m on, you two. They
been awful good, an’ it’s been a tough day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must have been a very tough day,”
Mrs. Hurst said. “They will like some
milk, and I have plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milk! My word, they ain’t seen milk f’r
a blue moon!” said their mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They shall have all they can drink now.
Can you fix the wheel, Danny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would ’a’ had a job if the ol’ cart ’ud
gone a hundred yards farther,” said Danny,
who had jacked up the wheel, and was busy
over it. “Dry as a bone, an’ near jammed
altogether. Oh, yes, I’ll fix it all right, Mrs.
Hurst.” He grinned sympathetically at the
woman. “Don’t you worry, mum—I’ll
bring the cart up to the house presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you put it into the big shed and
turn the horse into the creek paddock,
Danny? I’m sure Mr. Merritt would not
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not ’im,” said Danny. “Right you are.
Mrs. Hurst. Don’t you bother about
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gimme the baby, Missus,” said the
mother. “She’s too heavy for you to
carry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she is lighter for me than for
you,” Mrs. Hurst answered, smiling. “And
I like her—she is such a friendly baby.”
She held the dusty bundle closely as they
went up the slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—a garden!” said the woman from
the tall timber. “Oh, what a lovely garden!
Missus, I ain’t seen a flower for near six
months!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must show you all mine—when
you are rested.” Mrs. Hurst put her into a
big chair on the veranda. “Just sit quietly
until I bring you some tea. No—baby is
coming with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor’, it’s like meetin’ an angel from
’eaven!” said the weary creature. She sank
back, with a long sigh. “Micky an’ Joe,
don’t you touch them flowers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can’t do any harm—please don’t
trouble about them,” Mrs. Hurst said. At
the door she looked back. Micky and Joe
were standing before a huge sunflower,
their faces a study of rapt wonder—never
had they dreamed that the world could hold
so great a marvel. There were tears in
Mrs. Hurst’s eyes as she hurried to the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby, made happy with a drink, and
with hands and face hastily sponged, was
placed in an upturned box, where a string
of empty cotton-reels threw her into a very
ecstasy of joy: she was clearly an unexacting
infant, to whom much attention was a
thing unknown. There was a kettle boiling:
in a very few minutes Mrs. Hurst carried
out a tray. Her visitor tried to rise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you are to sit still. Baby is quite
all right. Drink that—don’t try to eat until
you feel like it.” She poured out two
glasses of creamy milk and put them, with
a plate of bread-and-butter, on the edge of
the veranda. “Come on, boys!” But
Micky and Joe held back, even when their
mother called them, overcome with shyness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re like wild things—they ain’t
hardly seen a living soul ’cept ourselves for
ages,” said the mother, apologetically.
“They don’t mean to be bad-mannered,
Missus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they are not bad-mannered—we’ll
be great friends by to-morrow.” Mrs.
Hurst smiled. “They will be happier if I
go away. Just look after them and yourself,
and don’t worry about Baby.” She
retreated into the house, and presently,
peeping through a curtain, had the satisfaction
of seeing Micky and Joe attacking their
first drink with faces that began by being
doubtful, and ended in pure bliss as the
glasses were set down empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can ’ave more,” she heard the
mother say, filling the glasses with a hand
that shook. “Drink ’em up, Kids. An’ you
be good boys, now, or your Dad ’ll want to
know the reason why when he comes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When’s ’e comin’, Mum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor’, if I knew that I wouldn’t be near
off me ’ead this minute!” said the mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin and Barry came in a little later, in
a frame of mind divided between triumph
and depression; pride in their unlawful
exploit having become damped, as they
neared home, by melancholy forebodings on
the subject of Mr. Merritt’s pig. They were
trying to calculate the probable value of the
victim to its owner, should it have been
spared to arrive at the dignity of full
growth, when upon their astonished eyes
burst the vision of a crowded kitchen. At
the table were seated a haggard woman and
two small boys—the latter shining from the
effects of a recent and thorough hot bath,
and clad only in clean shirts. Mrs. Hurst
was moving about, plying them with food;
while Polly, in a corner, her face alight
with happiness, fed an equally-scrubbed
baby. The baby sat on her knee, dipped its
fingers in its food, and clawed its nurse’s
face with them, while the nurse beamed, and
uttered incoherent words of pride. Danny
was filling kettles with the air of one who
insists on joining in a general upheaval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin and Barry stared—not with more
amazement than was shown on the faces of
the strangers, as the new-comers, guns in
hand, halted in the doorway. Mrs. Hurst
looked up and nodded brightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there are my warriors!” she said.
“Any rabbits? I hope so, because I shall
want some badly for to-morrow. We have
guests, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warriors looked at each other
blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so sorry, Mother,” said Robin,
in a voice of tragedy. “We haven’t got
one!” Resolve seized her. “Come on,
Barry—we’re sure to get some on the flat
by the creek if we hurry.” Her face fell.
“Oh, and we haven’t milked!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I done all the feedin’ and milkin,’ Miss
Robin,” spoke Danny, grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Danny, you’re a brick! Hurry up,
Barry—it’s nearly dark already.” They
dashed from the kitchen and clattered
across the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the visitors uplifted his voice in
the first remark he had made since his
arrival at Hill Farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t that feller got ginger hair!” said
little Mick.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BLACK SUNDAY</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Robin</span> woke early, after an uneasy dream,
in which Mr. Merritt’s pig had been flattening
her under a great slab of rock, while
its brother exploded plug after plug of gelignite
close by, apparently with the hope of
killing her. To breathe under the rock was
extremely difficult, and she was much
relieved when the final explosion removed
not only the stone, but both pigs, and left
her swimming down the Merri Creek Falls.
By great good luck she avoided the jutting
crag that divided the main fall, and swam
placidly down, using the breast-stroke very
slowly, and not at all inconvenienced by
being in a vertical position. This lasted
until she reached the whirlpool at the foot,
when the water immediately took charge
of her, whirled her round like a cork at
great speed, and washed her out upon a
slope, quite dry, which was curious, and
very breathless, which was what might have
been expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She woke, and rubbed her eyes, wondering,
half-sleepily, why she should still feel
the sense of breathlessness that had followed
her throughout her ridiculous dream.
Her bed on the veranda overlooked the long
stretch of narrow valley between the creek
and the foothills, ending in a great spur of
the range that towered into the sky, covered
with mountain ash-trees. It was a view
she loved: her first glance was for it every
morning, and she turned towards it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no hills to be seen. The valley
lay peacefully, looking just as it always
did, save that it was hazy, as though a soft,
transparent grey veil had been drawn over
the familiar outlines. But the hills had
vanished as completely as if they had been
wiped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew-w!” Robin whistled, sitting up.
“Those fires in the ranges must have come
down a good bit.” Her thoughts went to
the mother of Micky and Joe. “Poor little
Mrs. Ryan will be more worried than ever.
I do hope that Mick and Bill of hers won’t
stay too long trying to save their mill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got up, and, putting on kimono and
slippers, went into the garden. All the
hills that ran to north and south of the creek
valley were blotted out, as if the valley had,
in the night, become a kind of island, ending
in nothing. Although the sun was well
above the horizon, it was invisible. Somewhere
behind the curtain it was mounting,
already giving promise of a day that should
be hotter than any they had yet endured—there
was something sinister in its steady,
unseen force. The air of early morning
had no sense of refreshment and coolness.
It was heavy to breathe, and profoundly
still. Not a flicker stirred a leaf in the
garden. And Robin suddenly realized that
the busy chatter of awaking birds was altogether
absent. They were hiding in the
trees; there was no merry flutter of wings,
no cheery call of cockatoos beyond the
creek. The utter silence sent a little thrill
of discomfort through her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is too quiet altogether, even for
Sunday morning,” she said, with a half-laugh.
“It feels uncanny. I think I’ll call
Barry, and we’ll get the work done early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry came into view as she turned to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, you up?” he said. “Isn’t it a
beastly morning? I woke up feeling as if I
had been eating smoke.” His black hair
was tousled; he rubbed his eyes, looking, in
his pink-striped pyjamas, rather like an
aggrieved child. “I don’t think this is
going to be at all a nice day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s no bad prophecy,” Robin said,
laughing. “I think we’ll spend most of it
in the swimming-hole: it will be the only
place fit to live in. I was just going to call
you: we might as well get the outside jobs
done before it gets any hotter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea!” Barry responded. “I’ll go
and get some clothes on. Don’t go into the
kitchen, by the way, Robin: I passed
through there, and Polly’s terribly busy
making tea, to surprise you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I won’t,” said Robin. Her air
of delighted astonishment sent Polly into a
flutter of joy when, a few minutes later, she
brought her a steaming cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how lovely of you, Polly! I
wanted to get the milking done early, and
you’ve saved me ever so much time. Toast,
too! No one ever makes me early-morning
toast but you. I must take a cup to Mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I want to,” Polly begged, her big,
dog-like eyes dwelling affectionately on the
merry face, and on the shining red hair.
Polly loved Robin’s hair so openly that its
owner used to declare that it almost made
her reconciled to its colour. She put out
her hand now, and touched it gently. Her
greatest delight was to be allowed to trim
it—they had discovered that she possessed
extraordinary skill with the scissors—and
Barry declared that she treasured all the
clippings!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly time I cut it again, Miss Robin,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think it is. All right, Polly, you
can go at it any time you like. Well, you take
Mother her tea, and give her my love. Tell
her I’ve gone to milk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: good-oh!” said Polly. “Then I’ll
sweep all the rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t get tired,” Robin warned
her. “The Doctor will be angry if you do—and
so will I.” At which Polly laughed
as if it were the best joke in the world. She
loved to work about the house, especially
when she fancied that by doing so she could
save Robin; the Baroin doctor’s warning
that her heart was not strong enough for
much exertion had no meaning for her.
Robin and her mother had to watch her
carefully lest she should overtax her powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two rooms only, Polly—promise me, or
I can’t go and milk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly made a laborious mental calculation
of rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four!” she begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, two. Then we’ll do the others
together when I come in.” This was a bait
that never failed, and Polly succumbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-oh!” she said, beaming. “I’ll go
and get that tea now.” She went off happily,
and Robin departed in search of Bessy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she came back, a bucket in each
hand, Mrs. Ryan was standing on the back
veranda. The baby was in her arms: Micky
and Joe, still tongue-tied with shyness,
pressed against her skirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you slept well. Mrs. Ryan,” Robin
said. “You needed a good rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t sleep much,” the woman
said. “It was hot—and I kep’ thinkin’ of
them back there at the mill. It’ll be a bit
of a terror, you know, if that mill goes:
we put every penny into it, an’ we got a
first-rate lot of timber cut, waitin’ for the
road. It’s been hard scratchin’ to live, but
we done it somehow, knowin’ we’d get a
good cheque when we sold. But if the fire
comes——.” She shut her lips tightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may not come, Mrs. Ryan. Try not
to worry too much,” Robin said, pityingly,
knowing, as she spoke, how useless were her
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You an’ your mother have been awful
kind, miss,” Mrs. Ryan said. There was a
flash of gratitude in her dull eyes. “I’d
never forget it. But it’s hard not to worry
a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was the fire very near, Mrs. Ryan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so very near. We hadn’t been
worryin’ ourselves much about it. But it
got hotter an’ hotter, an’ the smoke come
down more an’ more, an’ Mick got thinkin’
about the wind changin’. If it did—well,
did y’ ever see a fire travel in the ranges,
miss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I’ve only seen very small fires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please God you’ll never see a big one.
In the ranges, with a wind behind it, it
don’t travel—it races. Gets into the tree-tops,
an’ jumps a mile at a time. There’s
no fightin’ it—you can’t burn breaks in that
big timber. Men might have a chance to
save their lives, but never kids. That’s why
Mick sent us off. But I wish’t I could ’ave
stayed. Only for the kids I’d ’ave stayed,
too, an’ let ’im talk. But kids are an awful
big argument.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused, trying vainly to look into the
hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind y’, we haven’t been fools. Mick
an’ Bill know their way about. We’ve cut
every stick as far as we could, all round
the camp, an’ burnt off all the undergrowth:
we been livin’ on a big patch of bare, burnt
ground for weeks. It’s awful livin’, of
course—I jus’ give up tryin’ to keep the
kids or anything else clean, ’specially with
the only water half a mile away, down a big
hill. Took over twenty minutes to carry
up a bucket, an’ half of it would be splashed
away before I got up. You get mighty
savin’ with water when you got to carry it
like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think you did,” said Robin,
under her breath. Bush girl as she liked
to think herself, she realized that there were
phases of life she did not comprehend.
This little woman, with her quiet face and
anxious eyes, was only one of many,
struggling and suffering quietly in the
lonely places. “How did you manage for
stores, Mrs. Ryan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not too bad. Mick or Bill took a
day off every fortnight or three weeks, an’
brought things back from the township.
I’ve got a camp-oven, so I can make bread
all right. I ain’t been off the place meself
for six months, ’cept for one day, an’ then
it was on’y ’cause Baby was sick, an’ I had
to take her to a chemist. That’s what gets
y’ down, miss: when the kids gets sick, an’
y’ don’t know what it is. An’ of course they
don’t get the right sort of food for kids.
But they got to manage on it somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave a short laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got a sister—works in a big shop in
Melbourne. She come to see us once when
she had her holidays, but it fair scared her.
She come for a week, but she on’y stayed
three days—my word, an’ I’d looked forward
to havin’ her, too, an’ I’d got the camp
like a new pin. Wasn’t Bill mad, havin’ to
knock off work again to take her back! She
said she didn’t know how I lived. Like
animals, she said—never a soul to speak to,
an’ no goin’ out to pictures or darnces or
things. Well I reckon I know all about
what it means not to have a woman to talk
to now ’n’ then. But she can keep ’er pictures
an’ darnces: I wouldn’t change my job
for hers, bad ’n’ all as she thinks mine!”
Her head went up with a queer little flash of
pride. “Bill an’ me reckon we’re doin’ a
job that counts!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think you are!” Robin said,
slowly. “And you have your three splendid
kiddies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—we got them.” She put her
tanned cheek against the baby’s soft face
for a moment. “But when you got to
choose between your man an’ the kids—”
Her voice died away; and Robin had no
words to offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breakfast was a meal for which no one
had much appetite, except Micky and Joe,
who wore an air of awe-struck bewilderment
at a world which held so many new
and unexpected things to eat. The heat
increased with a kind of bitter intensity.
No animals were to be seen in the scorched
paddocks: they had all sought the creek,
where they stood with hanging heads, in
dumb protest at the breathless stillness.
Robin and Barry agreed that it was too
hot to walk to the swimming-hole, with the
prospect of a worse walk back, to destroy
the effect of a bathe. Everyone seemed
restless and uneasy; people jumped at a
sound, without knowing why they jumped.
It was as though the still air was charged
with something mysterious and uncanny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, at eleven o’clock, came the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came with a far-off soughing, like the
sound of breakers on a distant beach. They
heard it for what seemed a long while
before they felt it; but at the first sound
Mrs. Ryan got up hurriedly and went into
the yard, where she stood gazing towards
the hills that she could not see. Nearer and
nearer: and then it was upon them. The
trees in the orchard bent suddenly, and one
old pear-tree snapped with a sharp crack:
Mrs. Ryan’s thin skirts whipped round her
legs: an empty kerosene-tin was blown
rattling and banging across the yard with
the first wild gust. A burning wind, like
the breath of a furnace: it caught the house
and shook it, and, racing on, whirled the
dust from the road into a dense, eddying
cloud. They shut the house against it,
closing every door and window; and the
wind howled and moaned as it eddied among
the chimneys, and swelled to a full-throated
roar, sweeping down the valley. So it blew,
unbroken in its scorching fierceness, for
more than sixteen hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Borne on its fiery breath came the
smoke: such smoke as made the valley
settlers realize that the earlier haze, by comparison,
had been but as a light morning
mist. It came in a dense, unbroken cloud,
blotting out the country, until it was impossible
to see more than a hundred yards in
any direction. The sun, a great ball of
angry orange, seemed to hang framed in
it. Like a wall of dull yellow the smoke
marched across the land, turning every
familiar object into an unreal ghost. The
very flowers in the garden lost their colour
before it: Robin’s crimson dahlias showed a
dull flame-colour, the blue of the plumbago
flowers a dirty grey. And ever the roar of
the wind grew louder and louder, and its
breath more laden with fierce heat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could not stay in the shut house.
Even though the hot gusts parched the skin
and choked the breath—even though they
could see nothing but the dense smoke-wall
that shut them in—no one could bear to
remain indoors. There was worse yet to
come, they knew: danger that must be
watched for, out in the open. And presently,
in the garden, came the first messengers
from the burning ranges: ashes, falling
thickly, charred fronds of bracken, half-burned
twigs, and fragments of bark. No
fire lived in them, but many were still hot.
They came more and more swiftly, until the
coverlets of the beds on the verandas were
black with them: blown so fiercely that many
were forced underneath the pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scorching wind grew wilder until it
was a very hurricane of heat. A new sound
began to mingle with its fury; a dull, far-off
roar that made the Hill Farm watchers
look at each other in voiceless fear. As
they stood by the fence, they heard galloping
hoofs, and David Merritt raced up on
a sweating horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you, Mrs. Hurst? They’re bringing
people here—the Gordon family and the
Watts and Duncans. There’s no earthly
chance for their homes. You must be ready
to make for the creek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the fire very near?” Mrs. Hurst asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows where there isn’t fire! All
the ranges are burning, on both sides of
the valley, and the fire is coming down fast.
There’s no fighting it, in this awful wind.
Eh, Robin, that’s a good sight!”—for Robin
had slipped away, returning with a long
tumbler of cool drink. He drained it
thirstily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every man in the district is out, doing
what he can—it’s chiefly getting people
away from the lonely farms back in the bush,
and from the sawmillers’ camps. They’re
sending cars out from Baroin to take
refugees in there. I think your place is
safer than most, for it’s surrounded with
green—but you can’t tell. Every bit of
woodwork is hot to the touch to-day, and
if a burning branch lodged on a shed roof
or under the veranda, the house would go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I see that,” Mrs. Hurst said.
“What should I do, Mr. Merritt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep a close watch, that’s all. There’s
no safer place than the creek down below
your paddock, for there are good holes with
no trees near them to hold the fire. That’s
the worst—the trees: the grass and ferns
go like a flash, but the trees burn so long,
and shower fragments everywhere. If the
house catches, or if you see flames coming
from the hills behind the smoke, make for
the creek—take blankets with you to soak
and put over your heads. And don’t leave
it too late to go! There would be men here
to watch your place only that we don’t
reckon you’re in as much danger as most of
the places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not need anyone,” Mrs. Hurst
said, calmly. “But is there nothing any of
us can do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t I be some use, Mr. Merritt?”
Barry struck in. “I could help the men!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my son, you can’t. We want only
men who know every yard of the country.
Be ready to do all you can here—you had
better take it in turns to watch, or your eyes
will soon give out—three men are smoke-blind
already. You might have food and
drinks ready, Mrs. Hurst: I’ll tell any of the
men they can get a bite here, if I may. They
may not have the chance, but if they do it
will be a help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be a comfort to do it,” Mrs. Hurst
said. “I’ll have boracic lotion made, too,
for their poor eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a real good idea. Well, I must
be off.” He swung himself into the saddle,
and then spoke again. “We’re pretty
anxious about Danny Sanders; his brother’s
splitting rails over near Gaunt’s Crossing,
camping alone, and we heard by telephone
that there’s a big fire there. Danny went
off at once on a horse—but he has five miles
of awful country to get through, and by the
look of it the fire will be across it before
he is. Well, it’s a black day for Gippsland!”
He wheeled his horse, and in a moment was
swallowed up by the smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must all work,” Mrs. Hurst said.
“Robin, will you and Barry watch, for the
present—one in front, the other at the back.
We will get food ready: and all of us must
eat something, for we’ll need all our
strength.” They battled against the raging
wind, fighting each step across the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m blessed if I’m going to let the house
go without putting up a fight!” declared
Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here,” Barry returned. “I say,
Robin, I’ll get boughs ready for beaters at
every point, and put buckets of water handy.
Gee, aren’t your eyes sore!” He rubbed his
own furiously, as he hurried off for an axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a comfort to work, even though
work was terrible, in the blinding heat.
Together they put the house in a state of
defence, as well as they could; and then, an
idea occurring to Robin, they dug a hole
in the garden and buried whatever money
and small valuables the house contained,
wrapped in an old mackintosh. Now and
then Mrs. Hurst or Mrs. Ryan took their
places, and they went in to snatch a morsel
of food, to bathe their smarting eyes, or to
help in preparing food and drink. In one
of the bedrooms Polly played happily on the
floor with the three little Ryans—only leaving
them to make sure, occasionally, that
Robin was not far off: when she would
stand by her for a moment, perhaps stroke
her sleeve, and then would return contentedly
to her charges. Mrs. Ryan worked
in utter silence, her face stony in its self-control.
And as the dull roar from the
ranges mounted on the rushing wind, no
one dared breathe to her a word of hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dazed people began to arrive at Hill
Farm: mothers carrying little children; old
men and women; boys and girls sick with
excitement and fear: all of them stumbling
in, half-blind with smoke, and stupid from
the fight through the gale. They scarcely
realized that in all probability the little
homes, so toilfully reared throughout years
of grinding effort, would be heaps of ashes
when they next saw them—some things are
mercifully beyond realization. They carried
just what they had been permitted to
save as they fled: little articles of value,
bundles of clothes, clocks that still ticked
sturdily: and one childless mother held in
her hand the little shoes her baby had not
stayed long enough with her to wear out.
They sat about in pitiful groups, grateful
for what the Hursts did for them, too dazed
to speak much. Men came out from Baroin
in cars, to take them away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safer there than here,” said one man.
“Though goodness knows, the township
would go like a flash if a blaze started anywhere—there’d
be no stopping it, in this
wind. What a hurricane! a bit of charred
messmate bark fell on my lawn, and there’s
no messmate forest within ten miles of us!
And there are no men left to fight in Baroin—every
man in the place is out fighting
somewhere. The fire-bell rings a new
alarm every little while—some fresh outbreak
reported from the country. The post-office
people have been doing great work
telephoning—but half the telephone-lines
are down now, brought down by falling
trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there fires between here and the
township?” Mrs. Hurst asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a dozen have started, but they’ve
managed to stop them—there are men all
along, to keep the track clear. I had a
narrow shave in one place: a burning tree
came down across the road, and missed the
car by inches. But a miss is as good as a
mile! They’ll have the tree cleared away
when I get back with my load. Sure you
wouldn’t like to come in, Mrs. Hurst?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “I think we are safe
here—and there is the creek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it wouldn’t be a joy-ride,” said the
man from Baroin. “One fellow met a wall
of flame across the track near Heathfield:
he made his passengers duck down and
cover themselves all over with a rug, and he
went through it at forty miles an hour.
Got through all right, but the rug was
blazing. Nobody even singed, however.
Your house had a narrow shave just now,
hadn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine?” She looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you know?” he asked, astonished.
“Just as I got up to the back, it was. Bit of
burning wood must have lodged against the
wall, high up, over the veranda: it was
beginning to smoulder. That red-haired
young daughter of yours was up with a
bucket of water, putting it out, before I could
get there. It’s quite all right now, so don’t
worry.” He went off to gather his passengers,
and Mrs. Hurst continued to cut
sandwiches with a calmness that surprised
herself. Robin was safe, evidently: and
the food was needed. She must not leave
her job.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no word of Danny Sanders.
The fire had raged at Gaunt’s Crossing,
wiping out a sawmill and a road construction
camp: but of Danny and his brother
nothing was known. Cars could not get
through, for the only track was blocked by
enormous fallen trees, still blazing fiercely:
one had been tried, and had encountered a
sudden shower of sparks and flying coals as a
tree came down—the car had been blazing
fiercely in a moment, and the men in it had
staggered out of the fire-zone on foot, glad
to find themselves alive, their shirts charred
rags. No one knew whether Danny had got
across the blazing spur to his brother. The
men who spoke of his chances shook their
heads doubtfully. There were sad hearts,
for everyone liked big Danny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slow afternoon crawled on. There
were no more refugees now; all who were
not still clinging to their homes, refusing to
leave while there was a chance of fighting,
had been taken in to Baroin; and rumour
said that the township itself was in grave
danger, from a fire approaching from the
east. All the men of the valley were fighting
to save their homes. The wind had
eddied, swinging from one point to another;
or long ago the blaze from the hills would
have swept down across the creeks. It
roared above them, the lashing tongues of
flame leaping half a mile at a time; their
sullen raging sound, and the mighty crashing
of forest giants, loud above the howling
gale. Even on the flats, limbs were twisted
and flung many yards away, and great
trees crashed down before the fury of the
wind; two men had been badly hurt, and
had been taken away, insensible, to the
hospital. The men, strung out below the
foothills, raced from place to place, as burning
fragments from the mountains fell into
the long grass—beating savagely at the
blaze that sprang up almost before the fiery
messenger had touched the earth. Women
fought with superhuman strength beside
them, or staggered from one to another
with buckets of tea—men and women alike
choking and crying with the smoke. And
all the while the cruel, scorching gale
howled, and they knew in their hearts that,
sooner or later, they must give up the
unequal fight and think only of saving their
lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dozen times the sheds or the house of
Hill Farm had caught—but always Robin
or Barry had been lucky enough to see the
first licking tongue of flame and to quench
it before it had fairly taken hold. Polly
worked with them, as quick to see as they:
as the day wore on she seemed unable to
let Robin out of her sight. Whether Robin
beat out a springing flame, or worked at
preparing food, or toiled across the paddock
with cans of tea, Polly was beside her—careless
of the blistering heat, always ready
with a faint little smile when the girl
looked at her. It was useless to beg her to
remain inside: she merely shook her head
obstinately, still smiling. And there was no
time for argument on Black Sunday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was four o’clock when David Merritt,
with blackened face and red-rimmed eyes,
raced to the house again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get to the creek!” he shouted, trying to
make himself heard above the shrieking of
the gale and that deeper roar that came
behind it. “It’s coming down like a wall—there’s
no fighting it! Take blankets—and
hurry!” He struck his spurs into his horse,
galloping to the next farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all prepared: like disciplined
soldiers they made their way out and filed
down the slope, leaving Hill Farm to its
fate. Only Robin hung back a moment,
calling to Barry. They flung the water in
their buckets over the verandas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that it’s much good,” Robin muttered—“it
dries almost before it falls, in
this wind. But it’s our last kick! Grab
your blanket, Barry, and run!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They trotted after the little procession
ahead—already dimly seen through the
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the men told me he doesn’t think
the house will go,” Barry said. “So much
green all round it, and no big trees that will
burn. And he said it was the very fierceness
of the wind that would save it, for the
fire will go past it in a flash. It’s flying
fragments that are the danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, goodness knows there are enough
of them,” Robin answered, stamping on a
smouldering piece of bark that fell almost
at her feet. “No, I guess it’s the finish for
poor old Hill Farm, Barry. And we’ve
been so happy there!” She raised her voice
as she saw Polly hanging back uneasily
before them. “All right, Polly—go on, I’m
coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was only yesterday,” said Barry,
in a voice of wonder, “that we were worried
because we’d killed Mr. Merritt’s pig!
Doesn’t it seem queer that it ever seemed
to matter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Mr. Merritt hasn’t a pig left,”
Robin said. “Dick Merritt told me when
I took him a drink that they had all died of
the heat and smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove!” said Barry, staring. “And
I’ve never had a chance to own up about the
one we finished. Well, I can do it to-morrow—if
any of us are alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’ll be alive, I expect,” said Robin.
But in her own heart she did not feel so
sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed strange to find themselves at
the creek, with nothing to do. The day had
been all toil and agony: now there was
nothing for them but the last effort ahead—of
saving their own lives. They all
plunged into the water, rejoicing in its cool
touch on their suffering bodies: the little
boys kicked and scrambled in the shallows,
with shrill cries of delight. The hole that
they had chosen was wide, and bare of overhanging
trees; there was a little rocky island
in the middle, and here they placed the
basket of food that they had carried, and
covered it with a wet rug, held down by a
slab of stone. And then there was nothing
to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing but to watch. Already Hill
Farm was only a misty outline through the
smoke. Behind it the roar of the fire drove
on the hurricane, each moment drawing
nearer: embers fell and sizzled on their
soaked felt hats, and spluttered as they
struck the water. They saw fleeing animals,
kangaroos and wallabies, that leaped past
them, blind with terror: near at hand a
splendid crimson lory suddenly flashed
downwards through the smoke and fell
dead beside them. The very air was full of
terror and death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, for the first time, behind the smoke
they saw the wall of flame that leaped down
from the hills like a hungry animal. High
above the trees it towered in rushing
tongues and solid roaring sheets, while the
hills shook and echoed with the noise of
crashing timber. Nearer it came—nearer
yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shrill, pitiful sound pierced the gale—a
horse’s neigh that was half a scream.
Robin glanced round sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s Roany!” she cried. “He’s
trapped in the next paddock—Dick Merritt
was using him. I’ll run and open the gate,
Mother—it will give him a chance, at least.
I can’t let him burn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robin—come back!” Mrs. Hurst’s
agonized cry was lost in the screaming wind.
Barry pushed past her in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go after her,” he said, between his
teeth. Already the slender, running figure
was dim through the smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst caught his wrist and held it
as in a vice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” she said. “You are all they have—and
you can do no good. Oh, pray for
her—pray that she may be quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='p275'></a>Roany was at the gate, pawing, uttering
terrified whinnying. Robin flung it open,
the iron latch scorching her fingers, and
the horse galloped madly past her, the
thudding of his hoofs dying away towards
the creek. Robin ran back, more slowly
than she had come. She knew that she
was very nearly done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the smoke seemed to split in two,
showing the fire as is whirled down upon
Hill Farm. Behind the green of the garden
the immediate blaze died away: but on
either side a wall of flame rushed through
the long grass and the dry bracken, driving
with hurricane speed towards the creek.
The hot breath of its coming blinded and
choked her. She knew the creek was near:
knew that she was staggering uncertainly,
her sense of direction gone. Then dimly,
through the dense smoke, she saw a
running, silent figure: Polly, carrying something,
and smiling as she ran. Only for a
moment, for Robin’s eyes could see no more.
She fell, blind and helpless, in the path of
the rushing wall of flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scorching blast touched her. Then
came a sudden weight of coolness and darkness,
exquisite in its relief. She drifted
under it into unconsciousness.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE LAST</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>Mother</span>, are you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear heart. Don’t try to move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—and I cannot see you, Robin. We
are both blind, from the smoke. But it will
soon pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are in your own room, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Memory was coming back to Robin—and
with memory, fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother—the fire! Is the house safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite safe—the fire has gone. It missed
the house, Robin—nothing is burned, except
the grass. The wind changed in the night,
and everything is safe now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin wrinkled her brow under the wet
bandage that hid her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t remember,” she said. “We were
in the creek, weren’t we? Oh, and I ran to
let Roany out, and the fire came—and I saw
Polly running, and I knew she shouldn’t
run. Is she all right, Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst was silent for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her voice came, it was trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—Polly is quite all right, now,” she
said. But Robin had caught the hesitation
and the tone that quivered. She felt blindly
for her mother’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not telling me something,” she
said—and found that her own voice was
beyond her control. “I—I wish I could see
you. Tell me, Mother. Is there something
wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hurst found the groping hand and
held it tightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will never be anything wrong for
Polly again,” she said. “She gave her life
for you, my darling. No—not burned—”
she shivered at the horror in Robin’s cry.
“She was scarcely scorched—her wet
clothes and hat saved that. She flung a
wet blanket over you, when you fell, and
went down herself: the fire was over you
both in the flash of a moment, thanks to the
wind. You were only unconscious, when we
got to you. But Polly—” her voice broke.
“The doctor says that her heart just
stopped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother—Mother!” Robin whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The doctor thinks she could have felt
nothing from the moment that she fell.”
Mrs. Hurst said, holding her closely. “Don’t
cry, Robin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was smiling when she ran to me—I
can see her face now!” Robin said, after
a choked minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was smiling when we found her, like
a happy child. No one could think that she
had felt either pain or terror. We believe
that she died in triumph, because she knew
she had saved you: and the doctor says we
ought to think that it is best for her, Robin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she has got Jim again,” whispered
Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—and they have found gold
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little by little the horror of Black Sunday
came to be known; in that wild and scattered
district it was impossible at once to discover
the full extent of the havoc the fires had
wrought. Polly’s was not the only one
whose life had gone out as a sacrifice.
There were men who had been killed by
falling trees: who had died fighting for
their homes: wives who had perished
battling beside their husbands, and whole
families whom the fire had trapped in the
forest. There were communities in which
every living soul was blind from smoke.
Hundreds were homeless and penniless;
townships were blotted out, farm-houses
reduced to a heap of ashes and twisted
iron. Starving stock roamed the blackened
country, seeking vainly for food. In the
towns where they could gather, the refugees
huddled, clutching the few poor possessions
they had been able to save—dazed and
bewildered, while the doctors worked day
and night, tending their burns, and kindly
homes gathered in the sick who had fallen
by the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, with the spreading of the news,
came the swift response of the country.
After the first gasp of horror the rush of
help followed. Women ransacked their
homes to send clothing, linen, blankets;
children gave their toys for the children
who had lost their all: the tide of money
poured into the coffers of the relief funds
until it mounted day by day in a wave of
gold. Men who were slow to give in
ordinary circumstances gave gladly now.
The whole world heard the pitiful story, and
shouted its sympathy: there were offers of
help from every State, and from far beyond
Australia. From the King’s whole-hearted
message of grief to the quick help of the
Chinese in Victoria, there was no heart that
was not wrung by the story of the fires.
The sufferers, dazed and homeless, as they
squared their shoulders to begin anew
could feel that, at least, their country stood
behind them to help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the neighbourhood of Hill Farm many
houses had escaped, the fury of the gale
having swept the flames along too swiftly
to let them fasten on homes where gardens
were green or where fire-breaks had been
made and undergrowth cleared. Merritt’s
farm was safe, and O’Rourke’s, and Sanders’:
and to the joy of everyone, Danny
appeared, badly burned, but safe, having
ridden through five miles of fire in time to
rescue his brother. Merri Creek village had
been reduced to a heap of ashes, and for
miles the new railway showed nothing but
blackened and twisted rails; but no lives had
been lost, and no one despaired. In the
hearts of everyone was the same quiet
determination—to build up all that had
been lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. and Mrs. Lane appeared on the third
day and took firm possession of Mrs. Hurst
and Robin, carrying them bodily off to Melbourne.
Mrs. Hurst did not resist. She
knew that the terror of Black Sunday, and
the shock of Polly’s death would cling to
Robin until her full strength returned; while
she herself longed to be out of sight of
the blackened hills and valleys, with their
fearful memories. Only one consideration
held her—Mrs. Ryan, who went about
whatever work she could find to do, or
tended her children, in tight-lipped silence.
No word had come from the lonely sawmill
she had left in the forest. It was
almost beyond hope that any good news
could ever come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on the fourth day, sitting on the
veranda, she glanced up to see two gaunt
and ragged men walking up the hill: and
at the same moment a dish clattered to the
floor in the kitchen, and Mrs. Ryan, clutching
the baby, fled past her, racing down the
blackened slope; with Micky and Joe at her
heels, yelping joyfully. Big Mick Ryan
gathered his family into his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were awful good to ’em, Missus,”
he told Mrs. Hurst, a little later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good?” she said: and laughed. “We
were all in the same box: it was a comfort
to be able to help. But I’m so sorry your
mill has gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—darn the ol’ mill!” said little Mrs.
Ryan.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• </p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>From a letter from Robin Hurst, Hill
Farm, to Barry Lane, Melbourne.</span>]</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a good journey back, though it
wasn’t half as interesting in the train as it
was in the car. The Ryans had all the place
in beautiful order. They are still here, but
the Relief Committee is going to fix them
up with a new sawmill soon, and they say
they will be just as well-off as they were
before the fire. I don’t know how well-off
that was, but it seems to satisfy them. The
boys will talk now, and the baby is beautiful.
So are Roany and Bessy and the calf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everyone asks after you, and Danny
came over and showed me your gun. Why
didn’t you ever tell me that you gave it to
him after the fire? He is terribly proud
of it, and expects to make a large fortune
out of rabbit-skins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the country is green again, except
for the blackened trees. They look dreadful,
but everyone is so glad to be alive that
nobody worries. And lots of them will
sprout out—the trees, I mean, not the
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Merritts say that Mother and I are
quite fat, so that shows what a splendid
time you gave us in Town. I always hated
Town until this time, but now I love it, and
I’m ever so glad Mrs. Lane has asked me to
go again some day. The worst part of it is
that one can’t go about there in breeches
and a shirt; but I suppose everything has to
have its drawbacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I have a perfectly wonderful piece
of news, which I left to the last on purpose,
because it’s so exciting. After you wrote to
Mr. Merritt and told him the sad story of
the gelignited pig (I had to pause while I
looked up gelignite—I thought it began
with a j)—he went down one day and had
a look at the place where we blasted the
rock, just out of curiosity. You know where
the big stone split off from the face of the
hill—I said the rock looked pretty, and you
said that was just what a girl would say.
Well, it was pretty, Mr. Barry, and it is
pretty still. And it has every right to be
pretty, because it’s marble!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Merritt knew a good bit about
marble, because he used to work in a quarry,
and he hadn’t any doubt: but rather than
excite our hopes he said nothing, but he
sent a lot of samples to Melbourne and had
them examined. And the report was better
than he had hoped it would be. And then
he got an expert down, a man he could trust,
to look into the matter, keeping it all very
quiet. But the expert says there is no doubt
at all, and that it will probably be a most
valuable quarry, and bring us in heaps of
money. So we won’t have to look three
times at a penny next time we want to spend
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always wondered what I would
do if I had a lot of money, and now that
there seems a chance of it, I really don’t
know. I want a car, of course, and some
really topping horses, though Mother won’t
promise that we’ll ever get them. But best
of all is knowing that Mother won’t look
worried any more. And next best is the
thought that I shan’t have to go away from
Hill Farm and learn shorthand and typing.
How dreadful that prospect was no one
could ever know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just fancy if old Uncle Donald had
known that wealth was shut up in one of
his hills! And if he could have guessed that
the red-haired niece he couldn’t stand
would go out with a rude little boy from
Melbourne and use his own old gelignite to
find it! But he’d never have had any fun
with it, and I’m sure we’ll have lots. We’re
going to begin by getting some poor little
youngsters from Melbourne, who have been
sick, and have only slum-homes to go back
to, when they leave hospital. I’m sure they
will like it. But I’ll make quite certain they
don’t find any gelignite!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Merritt says that he thinks his pig
was very lucky to die when it did. So do I.
But he is ever so pleased with the two little
pure-bred Berkshires you sent him. I have
offered him the first slab of marble as a
suitable monument for the pig we slew.
You might think up a poetical inscription.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t forget to come next summer,
Barry, because, even with the marble quarry
and all the excitement, it’s dull without you.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
